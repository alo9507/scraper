In 2020, will the wow factor return to consumer hardware? Will blockchain and 5G punch into the mainstream? Or will the world unify against Big Tech’s tax-avoiding practices? AFP looks at five themes shaping the world of technology, after a year in which debate intensified over the industry’s exploitation of its customers’ privacy. – 5G’s unfulfilled promise – Super-fast fifth-generation network speeds are meant to revolutionise communications along with areas like urban transport. But so far, 5G has failed to meet expectations due to the lagging build of infrastructure in many places. Apple has yet to launch a compatible phone, unlike rivals including Samsung. Wipro is adding a layer of smarts and security to your homes with its new smart doorbell. The rollout should quicken next year as more countries install base stations and networking equipment — although US President Donald Trump’s war on Chinese sector leader Huawei remains a wild card. As smartphone sales plateau around the world, manufacturers have been focussing more on ancillary services. “You have to sell the entire experience, the entire ecosystem,” Dominique Bindels, senior analyst for home and tech with London-based research firm Euromonitor International, told AFP. Highlighting Apple’s success in payments and peripheral devices such as AirPods, Bindels predicted that smart earphones, along with speakers and at-home devices connected on the “internet of things”, would be among the more dynamic sectors in 2020. Digital assistants such as Alexa and Siri may start talking to each other, after Amazon, Apple and Google this month formed an alliance with other industry players to develop a common standard for smart home devices. Another trend could be consolidation in TV streaming, after Apple and Disney joined Netflix, Amazon Video and some national broadcasters in a crowded subscription market. – Leap into the quantum dark – For the industry at large, business consultancy Accenture this year coined the acronym DARQ to denote four major trends: distributed ledger technology (such as blockchain), artificial intelligence (AI), extended reality and quantum computing. Unbreakable blockchain networks of computers have already been generating virtual currencies in the form of bitcoin and its ilk, bypassing the need for a regulator like a government or central bank. Facebook wants to make the tech respectable through its “Libra” project, but has hit political opposition around the world, and several financial partners have pulled out. Unwilling to let private enterprise dictate terms, China and other nations are building their own digital payments systems, which could see fruition next year. However, blockchain networks devour huge amounts of energy, and concerns will mount about their environmental impact as debate intensifies more broadly about tech’s contribution to climate change. – The price of privacy – Most companies are now actively engaged across the spectrum of another tech acronym, SMAC: social, mobile, analytics and cloud. For consumers, SMAC is felt in how we communicate with friends and how we search and shop. That is accentuating fears about privacy, after a series of data leaks at Facebook first laid bare how much of our online lives are exploited by companies and political parties. “People are becoming more conscious of sharing data but also in the same moment, the Nest cameras and smart speakers are flying off the shelves,” said Bindels. “There’s a huge divide. People have been learning to trade privacy for convenience. It’s just another currency.” Amnesty International, in a hard-hitting study last month into Facebook and Google, said that tradeoff amounts to a “Faustian bargain” which imperils our human rights. – Tech wars – To Beijing’s anger, Washington alleges that Huawei and another telecoms group, ZTE, are little more than shell fronts for Chinese spy chiefs. Ni Lexiong, professor at the Shanghai National Defense Strategy Institute, said US sanctions depriving those firms of access to US components would only encourage China to stand on its own feet. “In the end, once China has formed its own industrial chain in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States will also lose a large market,” he said. Samm Sacks, an expert on China’s digital economy at the Washington think tank New America, said the tech standoff could harm progress in areas such as precision medicine and AI-based diagnoses. The two countries have cooperated in research, “and severing that could have global consequences”, she warned. – Taxing times – The US presidential election next November will likely prove another flashpoint over disinformation peddled on social media. Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren wants Amazon, Facebook and Google to be broken up on anti-trust grounds. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is meanwhile due by June 2020 to present a “unified approach” for richer countries to levy a digital tax on internet giants. Some like France have gone ahead with their own tax, igniting another front in Trump’s multifaceted trade wars as the US threatens tariffs on a range of French goods.

The US Commerce Department blacklisted five Chinese tech entities on Friday in a new move against Beijing’s supercomputing industry likely to raise tensions ahead of a meeting between President Trump and Xi Jinping next week. The notice targets Sugon – a prominent Chinese supercomputer manufacturer – along with three of its microchip subsidiaries and a computing institute owned by the People’s Liberation Army. All of the entities will be effectively barred from obtaining US technology after the government determined they were “acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” Trade tensions between the world’s top two economies have spilled over into the tech sector in recent months, with Trump’s administration moving to essentially ban Chinese tech firm Huawei from the huge US market on security grounds. In May, it added Huawei to an “entity list” of companies barred from receiving US-made components without permission from Washington, though the company was granted a 90-day reprieve. Facebook and Google have since both announced they will move to cut off Huawei in order to comply with the US sanctions, further isolating the Chinese tech giant. Beijing has responded with threats to release its own blacklist of “unreliable” foreign companies and individuals that appears aimed at pressuring foreign companies to maintain commercial relations with Huawei. Earlier this month, Beijing summoned executives from American firms Dell and Microsoft and South Korea’s Samsung, among others, to warn them that any moves to ramp down their businesses in China may lead to retaliation, The New York Times reported. Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi are set to meet next week on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. For more news your way, download The Citizen’s app for iOS and Android.

Facebook said Friday it would cut off Huawei from its popular social networking apps to comply with US sanctions, further isolating the Chinese tech giant considered a national security threat by Washington. The social media giant said it took the step after President Donald Trump’s order barring Huawei from US technology exports over concerns that it works with Chinese intelligence. “We are reviewing the Commerce Department’s final rule and the more recently issued temporary general license and taking steps to ensure compliance,” a Facebook spokesperson told AFP. The California company said people with existing Huawei smartphones with Facebook apps will continue to be able to use and download app updates provided by Facebook. The move by Facebook is the latest to isolate Huawei, which had become the world’s second-largest smartphone vendor despite security concerns voiced in Washington. Google last month said it would cut ties to Huawei, making it harder to obtain major apps from the US giant. The Google decision would leave Huawei without the Play Store, the marketplace for most Android apps, and other elements of the mobile operating system. Facebook — which is banned in China but has more than two billion users worldwide — said its decision would affect its core social network as well as applications such as Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, which each have at least one billion users. The US sanctions were imposed May 15, but the administration allowed a 90-day compliance period that gives users of Huawei devices time to install updates and avoid a major disruption of the mobile economy. Isolating Huawei Huawei has indicated it would create its own operating system to replace the Google Android platform, but would need to develop its own app marketplace as well if it wants to retain users outside China. To keep up in the smartphone market, Huawei would also need to find a new supply of chips and related hardware, without US suppliers such as Intel, Qualcomm and Broadcom. To make matters more difficult for Huawei, it will likely be cut off from ARM Holdings, the British designer of semiconductors whose technology is used in most mobile chips. Trump’s move came amid US concerns that Huawei, a leader in 5G networks, would allow Chinese snooping on the high-speed wireless networks. His administration has also been trying to stop US allies from using Huawei equipment. Trump told reporters last month that Huawei was “very dangerous” from a security standpoint but then held out the possibility of dropping sanctions on the Chinese firm as part of a trade deal. The fight over Huawei comes amid a broader trade war between the two largest economies and sanctions imposed by the US president, who accuses China of unfair practices and subsidies.
