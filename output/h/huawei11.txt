Huawei Technologies Ghana has donated some groceries and confectionaries to the Cantonment Divisional Headquarters of the Ghana Police Service to support frontline police officers discharge their duties in times of the COVID-19 pandemic especially within the Cantonment enclave. The Items worth over GHȼ50, 000 were given to police personnel who have shown much dedication and commitment in delivering their mandate towards the protection of both citizens and foreign residents in the country. Speaking on the intent of the donation, Deputy Director for Public and Government Affairs at Huawei Ghana, Jenny Zhou mentioned that the donation forms part of Huawei’s commitment to give back to the society in which it operates. According to her, the Police Service has and continues to play a significant role in keeping the citizenry safe in times of the pandemic and beyond and the donation is a way to further support their efforts. Receiving the items on behalf of the Ghana Police Service, Superintendent Simon Peter Akabati thanked Huawei for the kind gesture stating that, the Ghana Police Service is appreciative of the ICT giant’s effort and support and looks forward to more collaborations which will help the police serve the district better. Since entering the Ghanaian market in 2001, Huawei has undertaken several CSR activities to support the socio-economic development of various communities in the country especially in the areas of ICT, Education and health. In the heat of the pandemic early this year, Huawei contributed to Ghana’s fight by donating ICT equipment which helped in the observance of various COVID-19 safety protocols, provided remote talent training, and supported network coverage improvement with unserved and underserved communities. Huawei will continue to create value for all Ghanaians through innovative technologies and social contribution towards the achievement of a fully connected intelligent Ghana and the world at large.

Huawei, the world’s leading technology company has announced the rollout of its new EMUI platform, EMUI 11, for an initial 14 flagship Huawei smartphones. Launched during its Global Launch Event on October 22nd, EMUI 11 brings a range of new software features, improvements to privacy and security, as well as a smoother and more intuitive user experience to help Huawei devices stay faster. Devices included in the update are as follows: HUAWEI P40, HUAWEI P40 Pro, HUAWEI P40 Pro+, HUAWEI Mate 30, HUAWEI Mate 30 Pro, HUAWEI Mate 30 Pro 5G, HUAWEI Mate Xs, HUAWEI nova 7, HUAWEI P30, HUAWEI P30 Pro, HUAWEI Mate 20, HUAWEI Mate 20 Pro, PORSCHE DESIGN HUAWEI Mate 20 RS, HUAWEI Mate 20 X, HUAWEI Mate 20 X (5G), HUAWEI nova 5T, HUAWEI MatePad Pro, HUAWEI MatePad Pro 5G and HUAWEI MediaPad M6. The initial rollout will be in two phases. The first phase will include the flagship devices HUAWEI P40, HUAWEI P40 Pro, HUAWEI P40 Pro+, HUAWEI Mate 30, HUAWEI Mate 30 Pro and HUAWEI Mate 30 Pro 5G, which receive the update by December 2020. All remaining devices will receive the update by March 2021. The update will be pushed by Huawei Over-the-Air (HOTA). What’s new in EMUI 11 Standout design and smoother performance From a design perspective, EMUI 11 offers a new-generation Always-On Display (AOD) experience with the addition of a new modern art style. Comprising mainly red, yellow and blue colours, the new AOD uses seemingly simple lines to depict a sense of inimitable elegance that seizes the attention of the beholder. The colour palette can also be customised. Instead of primary colours, users are free to personalise their AODs by choosing from an expansive spectrum of colours. Alternatively, users can use the colour extraction technology built into the feature by taking a photo of their clothes, purse, shoes or other accessories to generate a bespoke set of custom colours. The support for the feature varies depending on the device model. Integrating visually engaging imagery with intuitive interactions requires not only an aptitude for artist expressions but also extensive research into how people process information – also known as human factors research. EMUI 11 introduces Long-take Animations. Inspired by its namesake technique in the field of cinematography, these animations leverage the shared content or areas between two interfaces to produce a smooth transition from one to another. This ensures focus continuity, allowing users to keep their eyes on the most important and active parts of the screen, all the while enhancing visual smoothness and providing a substantial boost to visual recognition efficiency. Existing users should be no stranger to EMUI’s Smart Multi-Window, Edge Panel, Floating Window and Multi-tasking features. EMUI 11 introduces an improved Smart Multi-Window experience. The new operating system allows users to open multiple Floating Windows at once. These windows can be minimised to the new Quick Ball, which can be expanded to show all collapsed windows quickly with a single tap. Further, in response to user feedback, EMUI 11 adds support for adjustable windows – re-sizing is as easy and effortless as dragging a corner of the window. Productivity-boosting Multi-Screen Collaboration gets an update Huawei’s distributed technology on EMUI 11 brings new improvements to smartphone-notebook and tablet-notebook Multi-Screen Collaboration. At the time of launch, users could have two concurrent active smartphone apps running on a PC (future updates will bring that to up to three). With the update, users can easily compare prices between two online retailers, respond to text messages while catching up on TV show, or enjoy complete control with stock quotes showing on one window and a trading platform on another. Personal data stays personal, always In today’s information-driven world, Huawei remains committed to safeguarding user privacy with innovation. At present, EMUI 10.1 already supports Password Safe and more user-centric privacy features. Augmented with the CC EAL5+-certified TEE OS microkernel, EMUI offers comprehensive security protection for users. EMUI 11 builds upon the strong foundation with the introduction of Encrypted Memo, which secures personal memos behind a password or biometric check. Sensitive data on captured photos, such as location, time and model of the device used to create the image, can easily be purged from the media, preventing malicious actors from using the data for fraudulent purposes. EMUI 11 improves the all-scenario experience From the new UX design delivering beautiful visual and interaction experiences to powerful new enhancements to the Multi-Screen Collaboration and Smart Multi-Window offering a multi-tasking efficiency boost, EMUI 11 is shaping up to be a massive improvement over its predecessor. Since the launch of EMUI 10, Huawei has greatly accelerated the pace of the update roll-out. And with EMUI 11, Huawei reaches another milestone with a beta programme ready at the time of the OS announcement, a testament to Huawei’s commitment to the existing Huawei device user base.

Huawei’s Y series smartphones are designed to provide users with access to a powerful smartphone experience even at a friendlier price point. The newest addition to the series, the HUAWEI Y8s continues in the same tradition and brings to the table excellent handheld night photography with a 48MP AI Dual Camera system and powerful all-round performance, all in a stylish design. We got our hands on this new smartphone and here is what we think. 48MP AI Dual Camera Smartphone cameras are the rage these days, with certain smartphone brands focusing more on the camera more than other features. Huawei is known for putting some seriously powerful camera setups in its smartphones and it continues this trend with the HUAWEI Y8s. Packing a 48MP AI dual-camera setup, which consists of a 48MP main camera and a 2MP Depth Camera, users can take stunning photos and videos complete with rich aperture effects. However, the highlight of this camera setup is in fact its low-light capabilities. The HUAWEI Y8s’ Handheld Night Mode is a class of its own, mainly attributed to the increased light intake from the large sensor and AI algorithms that remove noise and stabilize the image, all resulting in a perfect shot in dimly lit environments as well. All it takes is scrolling to the Night Mode on the camera app and you can take images with up to six-second exposure. We tried this on city skylines and even in outdoor conditions at night and were stunned by the results. The 48MP AI Dual Camera setup also delivers solid results when it comes to shooting in slow motion at 480 fps to capture minor details in perfect slow-mo, while its Portrait Mode ensures beautiful portrait shots with rich bokeh effects that blur the background lights in designs and patterns. However, a key player here is the Master AI which not only assists in these shots but also recognizes over 500 scenes in 21 categories, including blue sky, snow, plants and more, which then optimizes each shot to come out perfectly. Meanwhile, upfront the HUAWEI Y8s comes with a dual-camera setup as well. The AI Dual Selfie Camera comes with an 8MP main camera and a 2MP Depth Camera, which contributes towards real-time bokeh effects for selfies, while the AI noise reduction algorithms optimize brightness and reduce noise for low-light selfies. Bigger View, Trendy Design At a first glance, you will notice that the HUAWEI Y8s has quite a large display. This massive 6.5-inch HUAWEI Notch FullView Display boasts an FHD+ resolution of 2340 x 1080 and is optimized for a more immersive viewing experience. Try watching movies, series or even play games on the smartphone and it is this display that makes the experience much better. Additionally, the screen brightness can also be adjusted under the sunlight for clearer viewing of text and images at any time of the day. The display also has a TÜV Rheinland-certified Eye Comfort mode that can help you relieve eye fatigue by lowering the intensity of blue light emitted from the screen. Meanwhile, on the back, the design ethos of the HUAWEI Y8s truly stands out. This gorgeous back panel comes in two simple and chic colour options while boasting a 3D arc design for a comfortable grip. The colour variants of Midnight Black and Emerald Green depict a dark night and elegance respectively, while its distinguished manufacturing process is evident in the final finish. This design is also quite dynamic and gives a different look depending on the angle from which light strikes. The back of the phone is topped off with the fingerprint sensor as well. Alternatively, users can also use the Face Unlock 2.0 feature to secure their HUAWEI Y8s. Powerful Performance The true quality of a smartphone comes down to its everyday performance and this is where the HUAWEI Y8s shines. Packing in 64GB of expandable storage up to 512GB and 4GB of RAM, users not only have enough space for photos, videos, files and games but also enough RAM to have everything run smoothly. A key focus of course is its battery life. Budget smartphones usually tend to have smaller batteries, however, the HUAWEI Y8s comes with a large 4000 mAh battery that is good to last for watching movies, attending video conferences or even through everyday tasks. This is topped off by the AI Power Saving Technology that brings to the table intelligent app management to further enhance battery life. At the heart of it all, lies the Kirin 710, an octa-core CPU that includes four large Cortex-A73 cores and four small Cortex-A53 cores for faster all-round performance, while still maintaining efficiency. Paired with EMUI 9.1, performance is boosted while gaming with GPU Turbo while system performance is enhanced with the intelligent Extendable Read-Only File System which improves random read speed by up to 20% and saves 14% storage. EMUI 9.1 also brings to the table fun features that enhance the user experience, including a Video Ringtone feature that allows you to record a short video in place of a ringtone for each contact. Each HUAWEI Y series smartphone is unique in its own right. It is safe to say that the newly launched HUAWEI Y8s continues in the same pattern and brings to the table a new smartphone that aces in low-light photography, boasts a stunning display and features powerful performance all in a stylish body, making it easily one of the best choices for someone who is looking for a brand new smartphone.

The trend also continues to the front camera, where the 8MP AI Selfie Camera uses hardware and software synergy for high-quality selfies, with the additional help of AI to recognize up to 8 scenes including plants, flowers, night, stage etc, for the optimum settings and enhanced beautification algorithms for perfect selfies. The HUAWEI Y7p also has a design ethos that makes it stand out from other commonly seen devices. With a massive 6.39 inch FHD+ HUAWEI Punch FullView display with a resolution of 1560 x 720 upfront with an extremely small punch hole in the corner, the HUAWEI Y7p gives users an immersive bezel-less viewing experience. This is further complemented by the gradient color finishes on the back of the phone which further accentuates the smartphone’s design ethos, making it aesthetically pleasing.
