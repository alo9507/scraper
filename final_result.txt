It was signed by Museveni on December 27 but not publicly acknowledged until now.\n\u201cThe president assented to the bill and it is now law,\u201d said press secretary Don Wanyama.\n\u201cThe previous law was discriminatory in nature but this has been dealt with for the good of Ugandans.\u201d\nThe amendment reimposes a two-term limit on the presidency scrapped by ruling party MPs in 2005 allowing Museveni, in power since 1986, to run for a third, fourth and fifth term in elections widely criticised as being unfair.\nWanyama dismissed the notion that the law was tailored to allow Museveni\u2019s sixth term as \u201cspeculative\u201d.\nBut veteran opposition leader Kizza Besigye described the law change as part of \u201ca well-orchestrated plan to have Museveni rule for life\u201d.\nMuseveni hails 317 MPs\nIn his new year address on Sunday, President Yoweri Museveni saluted the Members of Parliament (MPs) that supported the \u2018Age Limit\u2019 Bill.\n\u201cI want to salute the 317 MPs who defied intimidation, malignment and blackmail and opted for a flexible constitution to deal with the destiny issues of Africa instead of maintaining Uganda on the path of unimaginative, non-ideological, neo-colonial status quo ,\u201d he said as he concluded his new year address on Sunday that covered issues related to security, economy, integration, Africa and the Congo.\n\u201cBy so doing, they enabled us to avoid the more complicated paths that would have been required,\u201d he added.\nThe Constitution Amendment Bill 2017 was in the week before Christmas passed with the requried two-thirds majority. The vote result was 317 yes, 97 no.\nThe MPs passed the tenure of parliament to be extended from five to seven years. The MPs approved a 7-year term for Parliament and local governments positions starting with ongoing term.\nThis was quickly followed by approval of article 102 (b), lifting the age limit of 75 for one to contest for presidency.\nFinally the House reinstated the presidential terms in the constitution by passing clause 105 of the Bill. The clause states that, \u201cA person shall not hold office as President for more than two terms.\u201d\nWhat next?\nIn a letter to the Clerk to Parliament, the President signified his assent to the Bill on Wednesday, 27 December 2017.\nThe Act prescribes 18 years as the age for prospective presidential candidates, from the 35 previously prescribed by the old legal regime.\nThe upper age limit for presidential candidates has also been removed, together with that of Local Councils Chairpersons. Equally, Parliament\u2019s term has been extended from five to seven years, beginning with the 10th Parliament.\nLocal Councils\u2019 terms are also extended from five to seven years, beginning with the current tenure.\nGeneral elections for Local Councils and Parliament will now be held in 2023, from the 2021 envisaged in the pre-existing legal order.\nAccording to section 13(1) of the Acts of Parliament Act, \u201cevery Act shall be published by the government printer as soon as possible after the president\u2019s assent has been signified\u2026\u201d\nReport on the Uganda Constitution Amendment(No.2) Bill, 2017 by The Independent Magazine on Scribd", "article_link": "https://wp.me/p7FLkS-hDU", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "10"}, "shares": "0"}

After much personal and financial wrangling, Chelsea and Atl\u00e9tico struck a deal to return Costa to sender in late September. Costa\u2019s Chelsea career was effectively ended with Conte\u2019s now-famous \u201cthanks for the seasono\u201d text message after the FA Cup final loss, though Costa\u2019s fate had been sealed many months prior already.\nCosta, who was well-liked in the dressing room and (usually) by the fans as well, struck a diplomatic tone when asked about his time in London at his \u201cunveiling\u201d.\n\u201cSeriously, the supporters, the people at the club and my teammates helped me a lot. Chelsea is a great club and I only have good memories.\u201d\nCosta joked about \u201clearning English\u201d at Chelsea, while also talking about the frustrations of having to watch from the sidelines while Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s FIFA transfer ban slowly expired. But now he\u2019s ready to make his impact felt, as Atl\u00e9ti look to finish a solid second in the league (behind runaway leaders Barcelona) and maybe make the most of dropping out the Champions League by winning the Europa League (they face FC Copenhagen in the round of 32). Costa will also look to challenge his Chelsea replacement for the Spain center forward job for next summer\u2019s World Cup.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this moment for a long time. I just want to get in shape to play as soon as possible, I\u2019m tired of training. You can tell I\u2019ve already worked and prepared well to play, I\u2019m here to help the team and score goals.\n\u201cAtleti are not in the Champions League now, but we are going to fight for what we have left. I need to play.

The youngest one is 19 years old, that we have recorded so far, and the oldest is 93, so it\u2019s a wide spectrum.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say with binary options coming into play the average victim\u2019s age of investment fraud has dropped because previously it was over 60 and now it\u2019s early 50s.\n\u201cIt\u2019s because the younger generation are taking part in this activity, and it could be easily explained as social media is a lot to do with it, the advertisements and the pop ups etc.\u201d\nBinary options trading is currently regulated by the Gambling Commission but from January 2018 the Financial Conduct Authority will take over.\nIn other countries however, such as Israel and Canada, it has been banned completely.\nFrank Thornburrow, from Kent, lost his life savings when he invested in binary options. He has been unable to get any money back and told Sky News that he believes he was conned.\nHe gives one example from an email telling him that to access his money he would have to make 150,000 trades, which was money he simply did not have.\n\u201cThe last couple of years haven\u2019t been easy,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI lost my daughter couple of years ago when she died of cancer. I retired and I was looking for a way of making money so I tried binary because it looked good.\n\u201cAnd basically it was a big con, it didn\u2019t work out and I lost a lot of money. I\u2019ve ended up with a triple bypass, so that\u2019s the impact it\u2019s had on me.\u201d\nThere is also concern that students are falling victims to scam companies after gambling with their maintenance grants to \u201cflip\u201d their money, according to Action Fraud.\nThe advice from police is that \u201cif you don\u2019t know the field, don\u2019t get involved in it\u201d as there are \u201cso many rogue companies out there\u201d.\nWhich? carried out its own investigations into binary options companies and found evidence of \u201cbad practice across the board\u201d, with high pressure sales tactics and \u201cunfair\u201d terms and conditions.\nJenni Allen, managing director at Which? Money, said: \u201cWe found for instance that people making a deposit had to invest up to forty times that deposit to even access their money again.\n\u201cI think most worryingly we also found examples of where the actual data being used was rigged by the company so that your initial investments would return some form of profit in return but thereafter you would receive loss after loss.\u201d \u2013news.sky.com", "article_link": "https://bit.ly/2Cq2jbB", "comments": "1", "reactions": {"likes": "0"}, "shares": "0"}

And out of the ashes should emerge a well-oiled machine that will steer Harare back to the 21st century. Out of the ashes should emerge rays unbroken by the dark cloud that has been hovering over the Sunshine City.\nEverything is broken at Town House and the only way forward is to destroy in order to rebuild.\nWater is not coming out of taps and when it does, it is not safe to drink. It is always lights out on the potholed streets on which rain water stands still due to clogged storm- water drains. Rubbish collects, but is not collected while grass is only trimmed by the elements of the weather.\nClearly, the recent firing of directors is not enough. Everyone should go. Harare should be rebuilt from the ashes of its horrendous past.\nThe fired executives continued to earn between $12 000 and $21 000 from October 2014 to June 2015 in direct violation of a Government directive that the highest earner should take home $10 450.\nAnd as if that were not enough, as we report elsewhere in this issue, the entire workforce at the municipality is overpaid. For example, a council nursing sister pockets $1 527 while a Government nurse has to make do with $500. That means the council nurse who refers all complicated cases to the Government nurse earns three times more. This is ludicrous!\nIt\u2019s no wonder council collects $13 million a month only to blow $10 million on salaries.\nWe urge the Minister of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing, Cde July Moyo, to lead the process of reclaiming the capital\u2019s long-lost glory by employing new brooms.\nThe country\u2019s capital city cannot continue to run on autopilot. We urge Minister Moyo to treat the engagement of a substantive chief executive officer (town clerk) for Harare as a matter of urgency.\nA competent individual with a clear track record in management is needed to set up a lean mean machine that will lead a motivated workforce, which will regain public confidence.\nIn May last year we reported that Government had introduced a performance management system for urban local authorities, which requires every employee to have an approved workplan which is in line with the council budget.\nThe system, which was designed as part of Government measures to enhance service delivery to ratepayers and citizens, would result in the establishment of appraisal panels for each council comprising an official from the Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Ministry, a local Public Service Commission inspector and a town clerk or secretary.\nWhat happened to this plan? What is the performance of Harare City Council?\nSpeaking at the City\u2019s Second Hundred Days Rapid Results Initiative End of Term Review Workshop last year, Deputy Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet Dr Ray Ndhlukula said: \u201cGovernment is committed to continuously reform all public sector institutions in order to realise their purpose in life, that is, to offer high quality services in a reputable, accountable, effective and efficient manner in order to meet the contemporary needs of the citizenry.\u201d\nGovernment must be true to its word and reform Harare City Council. After having pioneered the implementation of the Rapid Results Approach for local authorities, Harare is still the worst run city in the country.\nThe people running the affairs of Harare have proved beyond doubt that they are out of their depth. New faces whose performance will be assessed by Government are needed today.\nAction and not rhetoric should be the new motto.", "article_link": "http://www.herald.co.zw/editorial-comment-town-house-needs-complete-overhaul/", "comments": "14", "reactions": {"likes": "41"}, "shares": "0"}

He said if one goes to the police stations, one would not find any confinement where these children should be kept when they are placed under lawful custody. He urged the Interior Minister to look into the matter and build new prison for the children, adding that they cannot share the same confinement with adults and are vulnerable to anything.\nOn forestry, he said when one talks about the forest, adding that the cutting down of trees, leads to desertification, but there are lot of forest destructive activities, among them is frequent occurrence of bush fires, which he said if not controlled can lead to lack of food for animals such as cattle, particularly in the dry season.\n\u201cThe drivers of the country\u2019s economy are agriculture and that bush fire affects agriculture because it leads to soil erosion, leaching of soil nutrients. Are we are aware that a lot of our wild animals are leaving this country for Senegal, because of frequent outbreak of bush fires in this country?\u201d he said.\nGiving statistics of bush fire occurrences in Tuamana and Kantora, he said from 2013 -2014, 550 hectares have been destroyed by bush fire; that 2014-2015, 1560 hectares have been destroyed; and in 2015 -2016, it has reduced to 335 hectares, which was due to the sensitization tour they embarked on with the regional authorities; that from 2016-2017 the menace increased from 335 hectares to 3998 hectares been destroyed, as no sensitization was conducted.\n\u201cI think it is high time your Ministry of Agriculture look into these issues, because agriculture is inseparable from forest, livestock to be able to diversify agriculture from crop production to livestock production. So if our forests are burnt every year, then there is no reason of diversification, because in URR good number of cattle are dying during the dry season, due mainly to lack of food as a result of bush fires\u201d, he hammered home.\nWhile commending one Haji Baniko Sisohoko for the humanitarian gesture he offered in pumping in 5 to 6 million dalasi in complementing government\u2019s effort to provide health care services of the populace, he implored on the Health Ministry to follow suit to cater for the health needs of his constituency which has a population of 30,000-40,000 people and provide them with health centers. He also urged the Ministry of water to intervene and address the water problem affecting his constituency.", "article_link": "http://foroyaa.gm/risky-job-with-mediocre-salary-mp-for-tumana/", "comments": "1", "reactions": {"likes": "3"}, "shares": "0"}

Jallow, has extolled Members of the National Assembly for the maturity they have demonstrated during proceedings at the adjournment debate of the National Assembly.\n\u201cThe quality of the discussion and the understanding of the issues makes me proud to say that we have a parliament that has lived up to expectations\u201d, he said.\nMr. Jallow said during the first republic, Ministers except that of the Justice Ministry were parliamentarians and that was why all of them had to come to the national assembly to attend sittings; that this is not the issue now. He assured members of their presence during sittings of the National Assembly whenever the need arises; that Government cannot operate any function without Legislators.\nOn tractors, Mr. Jallow cited that the millions of dollars that were in the name of The Gambia on loans and grants and the millions taken by the KMC to buy tractors, were used to serve individual interests; that the most important thing is they were taken in the name of the Gambian taxpayer, who are paying the loans used to buy these tractors; that it is therefore necessary for the new Government to investigate and ensure that the tractors are used in the interest of the Gambian people.\nHe said the fertilizer arrived late last year due to the political impasse, but assured Legislatures that negotiations are ongoing and henceforth, fertilizer and seeds will be distributed in a minimum of 30 days before the coming of the first rains; that the long dry spell has affected crops such as groundnut, coos and millet, but that notwithstanding this some areas have excelled in groundnut production and at present they have bought many tons of groundnut, as opposed to the last three years. \u201cThe National Research Institute (NARI) and the seed secretariat have been charged to look into both short duration and more productive oriented seeds that will go with the production level that we envisaged for The Gambia\u201d, he said\nOn road accessibility to rice fields and the transportation of products to the markets, he said they are rehabilitating many rice fields and roads to solve the problem of road accessibility; that efforts are underway in making sure the cooperative union and the cooperative departments are established.\nHe further said that they are trying to modernized, diversify and transform agriculture to be able to process and add value to the products in order to create job opportunities for the young people; that this is very important. He revealed his ministry\u2019s plan of going into livestock, poultry and horticultural production to produce, especially horticultural in the country instead of importing and to export them. He urged the MPs not to leave things with them (Ministers); that they have the direct link with the farmers who they are representing; that they (ministers) are appointed by the head of state, while MPs are appointed by the people and their interests can be connected between the Executive and the people on the ground.\nOn the issue of Ousman Jammeh and Co., he said they should have consulted him even though although he is not the appointing authority; that this was why he told them to write back to these agencies and admit their mistakes, without which he cannot accommodate them.\nHe thanked the MPs and apologized on behalf of his fellow Ministers who spoke in the National Assembly on Thursday 28thDecember, and their statements did not go well with the Legislators; that the NA is their biggest and most important partner; that the president and the ministers are appointed by law and the laws are made by them; that the Ministry of Justice use those laws to carry out its functions.\n\u201cIf anybody amongst us does not have respect for the Legislature, then you don\u2019t have respect for The Gambia as a nation. I was a parliamentarian for 17 years and I know the importance of parliament. You are the people who make Government work and to whom we are answerable and the representatives of the Gambian people who elected the president, who established the Executive\u201d, he concluded.", "article_link": "http://foroyaa.gm/agriculture-minister-extols-nams/", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "2"}, "shares": "2"}

Mr Tambadou made this remark during the adjournment debate of Friday 29th December 2017, at the National Assembly.\n\u201cWe should look at the laws establishing the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) to ensure that their responsibility properly reflects the intelligence outfit. So we are in the process of reviewing that law in consultation with the National Intelligence Agency\u201d, he said. He further said they have had the first draft based on consultation with organizations outside the country and shared their suggestions with them; that they are now looking at those suggestions and comments, to make sure that the name is not only changed but their functions and responsibilities too.\nOn the sale of cattle, he said Section 202 of the Constitution empowers the Commission of Enquiry, established by the president under Section 200, to issue interim orders which should not be arbitrary, but based on necessity among other things; that the decisions of the Commission that the Department of Livestock does not have the capacity to handle the number of cattle and the great risk of the cattle are dissipated as some are being unlawful slaughtered for food, stolen or dying, which if not handled will lead to a loss for both state and ex-president. \u201cBecause if the Commission comes back with recommendations that they rightfully belongs to him, they will or should be returned to him (former president), but if they die or dissipate, then of course he also loses when the decision is made\u201d, he explained.\nHe averred that when he received the letter from the Commission for the sale of the cattle, he engaged with the counsel to the Commission on the issue; that after their discussions, they agreed that while the Commission can exercise its jurisdiction to make interim orders in the abundance of caution, it may be better to approach the high court, which had given the original order of placing the cattle in the custody of the Department of Livestock.\n\u201cThis does not mean that the Commission does not have the power. In the abundance of caution we thought it may be better to approach the High Court and as a result of this, the sale of the cattle that was planned on Sunday will be suspended, to approach the High Court which gave the legal custody to the Department of Livestock to allow the sale of the cattle on the same reason and basis, that the Commission has taken in their decision\u201d, he pointed out.\nOn the issue of the Public Order Act, Mr. Tambadou informed the Assembly that in light of the Supreme Court judgment on the Public Order Act, they are on the stage of reviewing the Act; that it is very difficult to balance Acts when dealing with fundamental Human Rights with limitations; that this requires the need to ensure enjoyment of rights and other public interest and matters that need to be taken into considerations.\n\u201cOur thinking at this point is to tilt the balance in favor of the enjoyment of these rights. How far we are going to do that will depend on the review we are conducting, but that is a matter we are considering at the moment \u201c, he concluded.", "article_link": "http://foroyaa.gm/we-should-not-be-looking-at-cosmetic-name-changes-justice-minister/", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "1"}, "shares": "2"}

Hon. Jatta made this statement during the adjournment debate of Friday 29th December 2017. He said every member in the National Assembly understands the fundamental problems which the country is confronted with; that the essence of Ministers\u2019 presence during sittings of the National Assembly is precisely to hear the problems confronting the country through their representatives; but that the approaches of two of the Ministers who spoke on Thursday, left much to be desired; that their deliberations as Ministers should neither be defensive nor propagandist; but that hearing some of them speak, one tend to think that they are on a political platform and engage in propaganda.\nHon. Jatta said they know what they are talking about and they know the President; that they know who he is and how he is; that Ministers should not come to the assembly, to tell them about the President, but instead for them to look at the issues of the country and how best to solve them. \u2018\u2018That is your essence of being here. The information we have is a tool that you can use in many ways to solve the problems that are being confronted with this country\u201d, Hon. Jatta said. He further said that they are not telling anyone to provide answers to the questions, but that the NA in collaboration with the Ministers, should look at those problems and see how best they can be solved; that among them is poverty; that for 50 years, interventions have been made into poverty alleviation, but paradoxically it keeps on increasing.\n\u201cSo there is a problem somewhere. Why can\u2019t we sit down and question the different methods that have been used to alleviate poverty and they have not succeeded? What is the problem?\u2019\u2019 he remarked.\nHon. Jatta said when Members talk about poverty, they know what they are talking about and they can propose solutions; that the combination of the perspectives of Members and the Ministers, can help solve the problem of the country; that this is their essence of being together.\n\u201cI was not going to speak today if you have not come. That was my position. Because for me engagement with the National assembly takes precedence over all engagements. That is the position in PAC and PEC Committees, because we cannot deal with these problems without you and you cannot deal with the problems of the country without us. We must work together to solve these problems. That is the essence of it\u201d, he pointed out.\nHe emphasized that interventions have been made into these problems for five decades, but we continue to have the same end results; that if the approach given in section 217 3(c) of the Constitution was applied since 1965, a balanced development of all parts of The Gambia, improvement in the quality of life of the rural communities and redressing economic imbalances between rural and urban communities, should have been realized by now; that there are two types of migrations in The Gambia namely Internal and external migrations and that the causes are similar.\n\u201cThere is internal migration because all the opportunities are concentrated in the urban areas. So everybody comes to the urban areas to look for those opportunities. But we know that we can change that situation even overnight, because in the provinces people are producing almost everything. Why not create the facilities of transforming what is being produced there into something else, to create jobs and means of generating revenue, because if you create groundnut processing plants anywhere in the provinces, you are creating jobs there,\u201d he stressed.\nHe said last year almost nothing was exported in terms of groundnut and it is the mainstay of the economy. He urged that efforts should be made to ensure groundnut is utilized in the country and not exported, adding the country will be left with nothing to hang on and unless they address the problem from that point, poverty will never be alleviated; that it is not by putting in grants into things to eradicate poverty.\n\u201cYou must give the poor person the means to do away with his or her poverty. Give farmers the means to do away with their poverty\u201d, he explained.\nHon. Jatta said this can be done if groundnut production is not made a liability, but a means of going forward and living better; that thus one must create the means for the farmers to be able to market and transform their produce into something else and not to market it raw.\n\u201cSo when you say it is not who is criticizing who, they spoke as if you are criticizing them. We are not criticizing you. We know what you are criticizing is the same thing we are criticizing and having done this, we must think of how we must transform that criticism into a tool to transform negative into positive. That is the essence\u201d, he said\nHe said what the Constitution says has never been given any serious consideration; that he believes the Agriculture Minister thinks the same way as he disclosed his ambitions to revitalize the mixed farming centers which were key to the little progress that was made then and it is fundamental, adding that the Minister cannot do without that. He said the country must now think about new seeds and go for early maturing crops, because the rainfall pattern has changed and will keep on changing; that this is what they are talking about. He further said section 215 4 (a) and (b) talks about giving adequate priority in those sectors of the economy that can promote national prosperity; that the number one priority sector is agriculture which he said is vast and called for farmers to be paid in cash instead of promissory notes.\nHon. Jatta said there are sectors of the economy which are not given the due considerations and among them, is mining taking place in kombo and the one that was taking place in Tumana. \u201cDo we know anything about this and when the new government took over, did it make efforts to find out what was happening there? For four to five years and it was closed to the population, but nobody knows what was going on there?\u2019\u2019 he asked.\nHon. Jatta asserted that the country should know what was being produced there; that if anything was coming from there, it should appear in the country\u2019s estimates. \u201cThese are the things that we must know and utilize to help us move forward. That there is something in this country. Mining or not, we can develop and we can move forward with agriculture. We can transform this country into heaven on earth. But it is just a question of what method and sacrifice\u201d, he disclosed\nHe clarified that grants and loans do not help and emphasized that the Chinese owed nobody anything, but capitalist countries owe them trillions.", "article_link": "http://foroyaa.gm/defensive-approach-by-ministers-will-turn-the-assembly-into-a-battle-ground-sidia-jatta/", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "4"}, "shares": "4"}

This is incredibly humbling for me,\u201d Kajoloweka said.\n\u201cThere are so many other patriots who are doing amazing work in strengthening the accountability architecture and giving good governance a relevant meaning in this country,\u201d he added.\nKajoloweka continued: I wish to take this opportunity to invite young people in this country to get more angry with the current state of affairs and join this struggle from the front as we continue to push this caravan of accountability forward .\n\u201cThere is no better time to serve this country than today. We must act with boldness .\u201d\nKajoloweka is ardent front-line human rights defender, Founder and Executive Director of an emerging governance watchdog in Malawi named Youth and Society (YAS).\nYAS\u2019 mission is to promote and defend human rights and democratic governance in Malawi through capacity building, advocacy, and research.\nSince 2015, Kajoloweka has risen to a prominent governance advocate in Malawi leading the ordinary citizens and the country\u2019s civil society in pursuing controversial accountability queries in government through strategic public litigation.\nBelow are the three recent prominent accountability cases he has led:\nIn 2016-17, as an individual advocate, Kajoloweka led three NGOs namely Church and Society of Livingstonia Synod, Youth and Society (YAS), and Centre for Development of People (CEDEP) in demanding accountability from the Government of Malawi on the procurement of maize from the Republic of Zambia which was attended by serious and organized corruption at the height of a food shortage crisis that gripped the country in 2016. This corruption scheme dubbed \u201cMaize-Gate\u201d involved top public servants, business tycoons and one senior Cabinet Minister. This issue though started in 2016 went on in 2017 and its results dominated the media in 207 as will be seen below.\nThis high-level accountability advocacy among others registered the following:\n(1) the suspension of Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development, Hon. George Chaponda by the High Court \u2013 following an injunction obtained by Kajoloweka;\n(2) The President sacking the implicated Minister from the Cabinet;\n(3) Former Minister, alongside two businesspersons Rashid Tayub of Transglobe Produce Export Limited and Grace Mijiga Mhango, who also chairs the Grain Traders and Processors Association of Malawi\u2014were arrested in connection with alleged corrupt practices during the procurement of maize, and are currently answering corruption charges in court pursued by the Anti-corruption Bureau (ACB);\n(4) Dismissal of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and other top Managers of the state-grain trader ADMARC implicated in the scandal. It must be further stressed that while the success to the maize gate was a collective effort with Parliamentary Committees led by Chidanti Malunga playing a crucial role in the later stages, it is in fact the litigation path taken by Kajoloweka and others (as mentioned above) which led to the obtaining of an injunction suspending Chaponda which was a critical juncture ( or great milestone and historical) in the whole maize gate saga as it led to great public attention on the issue and hence subsequent reactions from the executive and the legislature. It only required the boldness of an individual to lead such a legal path on such a sensitive issue.\nSecondly, in 2017, Kajoloweka as Executive Director of YAS led four civil society organisatons s namely Centre for Human Rights and Rehabilitation (CHRR), CEDEP and Church and Society of Livingstonia Synod, and YAS in yet another controversial accountability struggle, challenging the looting (abuse) of public resources from eight state institutions by the ruling party, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) through a fundraising dinner dubbed \u201cBlue Night\u201d.\nThe advocate and others are currently pursuing this case is in the High Court of Malawi, Zomba registry. This advocacy campaign will go a long way challenging impunity and abuse of public resources and public institutions by the ruling political parties in Malawi as well as re-enforcing the separation of government activities from those of ruling political parties.\nLastly, in November 2017, Kajoloweka as Executive Director of YAS together with CHRR is pursuing another high-risk accountability case in the Supreme Court of Appeal involving a Water pumping project by the Malawi Government through the Lilongwe Water Board \u2013 a state water authority.\nThe thrust of the case is that Lilongwe Water Board and other public institutions involved in the project flouted Environment Management Act and Public Procurement Act. YAS and CHRR believe that these issues are indicative of the rampant culture of flouting laws at various levels of public authorities and agencies which is often attended by corruption, hence must be challenged.\nIn summary, looking at the achievements he has done and then considering his age (a youth) Charles Kajoloweka is best suited for the Nyasa Times personality of the year.\nThe young man has not only been a blessing to the nation at large but also to the youth in Malawi that given the platform they can be able to courageously represent the interests of the marginalised and the voiceless. Kajoloweka background to activism can be traced to his days at Mzuzu University where he was the President of the Students Union.\nFollow and Subscribe Nyasa TV :\nSharing is caring!", "article_link": "https://www.nyasatimes.com/charles-kajoloweka-delighted-nyasa-times-person-year-award/", "comments": "8", "reactions": {"likes": "21"}, "shares": "0"}

Many of the students were orphaned in August.\nFrancis Abu Sankoh, a community leader, said the government had told him everyone eking out a precarious living had to get out by mid-November, but he refused to cooperate.\n\u201cWe will not force these people to leave while they still have nowhere else to stay,\u201d he told AFP, saying he knew of nearly 200 households living in half-finished structures in Regent.\nRelief workers are meanwhile exhausted after four months filling in for a government that is too under-resourced to carry out basic disaster management, with the Red Cross handing out its own payments of $300 to 1,000 people in late December.\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of government to provide financial support and housing for them,\u201d Crisafulli added, as he prepared for the imminent departure of around 100 pregnant women and new mothers.\nHe noted that the government had promised to give financial assistance to child victims via a mobile money wallet, but they were yet to receive anything. Children who lost their parents would remain at the center, he said.\nSome orphaned children were taken in by families, but many are too poor to feed another mouth while facing their own dire straits, said Cecelia Mansaray a project officer for British charity Street Child.\n\u201cPeople are still suffering months after the disaster,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have cases of people in unfinished buildings around Regent, Kaningo and Kamayama who had no place to go after they had left the emergency camps.\u201d\nIn the last 15 years, four major floods have affected more than 220,000 people in Sierra Leone and caused severe economic damage, according to a World Bank report issued in September.\nThis summer\u2019s was the deadliest yet: 1,141 people were declared dead or unaccounted for, according to official figures.\nThe World Bank estimates that $82.41 million is needed over the next three years for the recovery, or about 2.2 percent of the gross domestic product, including rebuilding the six health centers and 59 schools affected. Access to clean drinking water is also a serious problem.\nEfforts to resettle flood victims in previous years have failed, as the government has directed them to Mile Six, an area without transport links, running water or electricity \u2014 even if it is safe from the weather \u2014 meaning residents soon drift back to dangerous neighbourhoods that have easier commutes.\nIsmail Tarawali, head coordinator of the Office of National Security, which oversaw relief efforts, has accused some families of making \u201cfake claims\u201d for survivor packages.\nIn the medium to long term, Tarawali said affected households would be given extra relief \u2014 if there was money to pay for it.\nMeanwhile, 52 affordable houses with basic facilities are also under construction at Mile Six, and a mortgage scheme will be developed for survivors who had valid land permits for their damaged houses, he said.\nBut eligibility will likely only apply to a tiny fraction of the victims, while the rest will find themselves back where they already were, living on the edges of society with everything to lose from next year\u2019s floods.\nThis story has been published, courtesy of PRI International\nRelated", "article_link": "http://www.thesierraleonetelegraph.com/four-months-on-sierra-leone-mudslide-survivors-have-nowhere-to-live/", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "0"}, "shares": "0"}

Dick\u2019s cult novel of the same name, blockchain is everywhere right now. The technology that underpins the bitcoin cryptocurrency and lots of other zeitgeisty developments, blockchain crops up as a miracle solution so often that you could be forgiven for thinking that it was the solution to all the world\u2019s problems. Unsurprisingly, the higher education sector has some intriguing ideas for how the technology could be used.\nA start-up company called Doctors Link has created a blockchain-based \u201cdigital passport\u201d for doctors, which gathers together a verifiable record of professional accreditation and training, while the University of Northampton-supported Blockchain Alliance for Good has developed a cryptocurrency that records social value (you could be receiving \u201ceduCoin\u201d for volunteering in the community, or for releasing your research data under a Creative Commons licence for reuse).\nAnother more controversial use of blockchain could be in reducing the friction of border checks and customs processes when the UK leaves the EU. And with today\u2019s economy predicated on a highly mobile professional workforce, the UK can use all the help we can get. But there\u2019s another side to Brexit that we need to be planning for: what happens if international students simply can\u2019t get to the UK to study at their universities and colleges of choice?\nLearning analytics for a better Brexit?\nSo how can we help international students who are no longer able to obtain visas? One way would be for institutions to step up their use of techniques like blended learning and augmented reality \u2013 and if we don\u2019t do it, someone else will.\nThe online education startup Udacity is promoting its \u201cnanodegree\u201d in self-driving car engineering. This is a wholly online course complemented by mentoring from engineers already working in this sector. What\u2019s really telling about this nanodegree is that no universities are involved \u2013 Udacity has completely bypassed the sector and gone directly to the firms that desperately need people with these new skills. Universities should be wary of being sidestepped by such programmes.\nLearning analytics could really help universities to stay ahead of the game; it\u2019s all about repurposing data that come out of our interactions with IT systems. This information is typically overlooked, but potentially has great value. Simple things like taking a library book out on loan or clicking on a link in the virtual learning environment can tell us a lot about how engaged a student is with their course. Putting these data together lets us use artificial intelligence to predict which interventions might help a student to achieve their full potential.\nAt Jisc we\u2019ve worked with software vendors and about 100 universities and colleges to create a national \u201clearning analytics service\u201d, along with common standards that we hope will be transferable internationally.\nGoing underground: academia takes to the \u2018Dark Web\u2019?\nIssues around freedom of movement are one problem higher education must contend with in 2018, but on both sides of the Atlantic there\u2019s also a distrust of experts and, yes, intellectuals (stoked by far Right media outlets). There is something insidious going on here \u2013 deliberate damage is being done to the scientific record and the practice of science.\nPerhaps the most notable example of this vandalism is in the field of climate change, with the wilful destruction of online climate data from some US federally funded programmes. It has been heartening to see the climate science community come together to preserve as much data as possible through collaborations like Data Refuge and Climate Mirror. It\u2019s not hard to see the crunchier end of academia being forced, in some countries, to resort to the tools of the Dark Web in order to continue functioning.\nLet\u2019s do everything we can to ensure that the UK doesn\u2019t become one of them.\nWe are all librarians\nAnother defining UK trend of recent years has been the forced closure of community centres and libraries as councils frantically struggle to reduce their expenditure. In many cases these facilities have reopened on a volunteer basis, but is there a role here for institutions in supporting their local community \u2013 for example, by letting staff participate in community-owned social enterprises like Libraries Unlimited, which now runs Devon\u2019s public libraries?\nIf we think about the future social purpose of our universities and colleges, there is a much deeper role here for our institutions \u2013 playing an active part in community and in the upskilling of children and adults alike.\nThe Code Club project from the Raspberry Pi Foundation has shown us the power of this kind of idea \u2013 there are now more than 6,000 Code Clubs in the UK alone, teaching coding to over 86,000 children. Our institutions could step up to play a more formal role, say by turning abandoned libraries into maker spaces, and reaching out to adults who desperately need up-to-date digital skills in order to find work.\nWhether it\u2019s being led by start-ups or social projects, edtech is taking its place centre stage within the higher education sector, and 2018 will no doubt see more developments afoot. Let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re ready to embrace the possibilities for positive change in our institutions and beyond.\nMartin Hamilton is a futurist at Jisc.\nThis article first appeared on THE\n\u00a9 2018, The Chronicle of Education.

{"articleId": "2107482075945358", "year": "2018", "month": "01", "day": "02", "publication": "ugandaobserver", "article_text": "The Archbishop of Kampala, Cyprian Kizito Lwanga has wasted no time in responding to President Yoweri Museveni's harsh criticism against the clergy in his New Year's message.\nYesterday, Museveni said religious leaders are behaving as if they are an authority on everything, speaking in favour of people they fancy so they can get them into political power.\n\"Some of our religious people are so full of arrogance. They talk most authoritatively on all and everything even when they have not bothered to find out the truth. This is assuming they do not have evil intentions which would be worse. That would make them into the Kayaffas, the Chief Priest, that betrayed Jesus\", Museveni said.\nBut less than 24 hours later, Archbishop Lwanga in his New Year's homily at Rubaga cathedral today hit back at the president, saying the clergy are simply playing their cardinal role as citizens to participate in nation building, and as well as resisting bad politics as President Museveni himself once asked Ugandans to.\n\"The president, one day said all of us belong to the Movement system and he explained to us why he started the National Resistance Movement. He said; 'I want people to resist [] bad politics'. So he commanded people to resist bad politics. He said we should resist bad politics, and I think he was right there. Clap for it [loud and long clapping]. Let us resist bad politics, let us resist bad politics and promote national unity because we\u2019re all interested in this country and also to build a strong future for this country\", Lwanga said.\nThis was the gist of Dr Lwanga's New Year's message that hinged on promoting democracy, good governance and resisting bad politics. Since the tabling of the age limit bill in September and its subsequent passing by parliament in December last year, religious leaders have increasingly become more critical of the political leadership especially members of parliament for ignoring the views of their people on the bill.\nThe controversial and largely unpopular bill, lifts the upper age limit previously capped at 75 years. It also lowered the lower age limit from 35 to 18 years. Following the clergy's fierce criticism, government spokesperson Ofwono Opondo said the religious leaders had overstepped their mandate. He implored them to stand for political positions if they want their views to be considered.\nToday, every time Archbishop Lwanga quoted the Constitution on freedom of expression or Museveni's historical remarks, he was loudly cheered by the congregation. He referred to the National Resistance Movement (NRM's) 10-point Programme stipulated by Museveni in his book, Sowing the Mustard Seed, as a good guide in the work of national renewal.\nLwanga said as he read the 10-point programme that in democracy, people give in their views and then governments choose the best. \"All these ten points are very good for nation building,\" he said amidst applause.\nLwanga noted that all Ugandans have the duty to promote not division or bad politics but national unity for the development of the country.\n\"Another good guide in this country in our work of national renewal, is the 10-point programme of the National Resistance Movement stipulated by the president in his book, Sowing the Mustard Seed. He enumerated the 10 points, By the way, they are very interesting .\nThe first one is to restore democracy. What does that mean? People trade in views and then you choose the best. Two; restoration of security of person and property\u2026consolidation of nation unity and elimination of all forms of sectarianism. So we all have a duty to promote nothing else, not divisions but national unity. These 10 point programme are very good for nation building. We thank our dear president for having highlighted them in his book. Let us implement them and do nothing else but for God and our country,\" Lwanga said.\nNot done, Archbishop Lwanga went on to remind the president and Ofwono Opondo, the Uganda Media Centre executive director and government spokesperson, who last week argued that religious leaders, who, think they command people's thoughts are deceiving themselves that the Constitution grants everyone the freedom of expression.\nOpondo accused Lwanga last week of letting his congregation heckle the Vice President Edward Kiwanuka Ssekandi as he delivered his Christmas message. Lwanga said religious leaders are citizens whose freedom of expression is enshrined in Article 29 of the Constitution \"if it has not also been amended.\"\n\"We have all the right to speak, Article 29 stipulates the protection of freedom of conscience, freedom of own expression, freedom of movement. This means, that every citizen or every person has a right to freedom of speech and expression, freedom of thoughts.\nAll of us should therefore be aware that the life of our nation is not a responsibility of a few individuals alone but a common social responsibility of all citizens of this country. I therefore appeal to all concerned especially politicians or even journalists, please read and understand the Constitution of Uganda before making abusive utterances on innocent people - be it religious leaders, politicians or others. That Constitution is for all us without any category of people,\" he added.\nOn Opondo's suggestions that the clergy remove their cassocks and join the murky waters of politics, Lwanga said religious leaders are not and will not be interested in politics but their views must be respected as well.\n\"Today people are calling us, especially religious leaders names and even at times abusing us, saying religious leaders must not talk about national issues. 'If they want to talk about them, let them come out and stand for political posts'. I would like to assure everybody, don't get worried of us. We\u2019re not interested in political posts.\nWhat we\u2019re just doing is our work. So whoever maybe worried that we do what we do and say what we say because we want to stand, it is not true. We\u2019re not interested and we shall not have interest either. What is being said is a wrong approach which diverts people from the sovereignty of the people which the national Constitution gives us all\u2026Amongst the duties stipulated of a citizen in the Constitution, is to respect the freedom and rights of others to speak\"", "article_link": "http://observer.ug/news/headlines/56515-archbishop-lwanga-hits-back-at-museveni-ofwono-opondo.html", "comments": "92", "reactions": {"likes": "477"}, "shares": "175"}

Any position of leadership in the country wouldn\u2019t even be worth contesting anymore. Maybe that would be a nice thing, as the survivors would be spared the nastiness of political contests.\nThank God 2017 is done. It has certainly brought out the nastiest side of us Ugandans.\nIn 2018, we must behave better, otherwise if the 2017 trend continues, we will be in real trouble. Any position of leadership in the country wouldn\u2019t even be worth contesting anymore. Maybe that would be a nice thing, as the survivors would be spared the nastiness of political contests.\nOne of the nastiest developments in 2017 was how people shared and laughed at morbid jokes. It so happened that several prominent people died in the country, and the social media went into overdrive with lurid jokes about their deaths. It became customary to expect imaginary conversations to be posted on social media between the dead person and those who died earlier as they meet in hell.\nWhen the imaginary conversations between the dead became tiring, they started posting conversations between the dead and the living. When the social media script writers got tired of those, they started serving up lies by announcing deaths of people who are still alive and well.\nLiving people pronounced dead included a prominent retired clergyman and a young woman married to a top musician. Then there was a prominent educationist who died after he built several quality high schools and several dozen children were presented as his biological products at the funeral. The jokes about how he managed this and what he proceeded to do in hell almost choked the Internet.\nWhy this bizarre behaviour became popular is unclear. Is it due to economic frustration or increasing alcoholism?\nAt the high leadership levels, the country trended in world media when our national parliament in September became an arena of a brawl between unidentified security men and dozens of MPs, whom the former were trying to evict after the Speaker suspended them.\nThis was over a Bill to remove the age limits on the presidency, which has since been passed. The men conducting the arrests were not parliamentary police, and it is still unclear how they gained access to the chamber.\nThe Speaker has written to the President, who is also the Commander-in-Chief, demanding an explanation. She is yet to get one as far as the public knows. Several expelled MPs suffered serious injuries and were hospitalised.\nThen for several months, dozens of young women were raped, tortured and brutally murdered in two locations close to the capital. Then a few senior security officers were arrested by the army for allegedly selling off refugees back to the very foreign powers they had fled from. The case is till ongoing in the court martial.\nThe year closed on another bizarre note, when a gang of notorious killers and robbers appeared on national television announcing that they had denounced crime and were instead now co-operating with authorities to fight it.\nThen they confused the public by saying their problem was that senior security officials are still trying to deploy them on robbery missions. One fellow ,who had been trying to literally buy his way to fame, has ushered in the new year in prison, charged with shooting his neighbour.\nThe man suddenly appeared on the scene and started donating money to people who were lining up with petitions to have their financial problems solved. Then, without warning, he picked up a gun, shot and seriously wounded his neighbour. Keeping up with the happenings in Uganda can be dizzying.\nJoachim Buwembo is a social and political commentator based in Kampala.", "article_link": "http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/oped/comment/Uganda-year-ender-2017/434750-4248560-wcwtetz/index.html", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "5"}, "shares": "0"}

The Meeting also approved the appointment of Foresight Accounting Firm as the new External Auditors of the Federation for the next three (3) years, as decided by last year\u2019s AGM.\nIn addition to the above, the Meeting approved the following amendments of the GFF Statute, including an Eligibility Check and Term Limits for Elective Positions in the GFF Executive: 1. Article 34 of the Constitution was amended by inserting a new article, 34A: \u201cthe Executive Committee may co-opt up to two members into the Executive based on their technical competence and subject to them passing Eligibility Check to be conducted with the assistance of FIFA or CAF\u201d. 2. Article 34.4 of the Constitution was also amended by inserting the following new paragraph; (e): \u201cpass Eligibility Check to be conducted with the assistance of FIFA or CAF\u201d. This means that for one to be qualified to be elected into the GFF Executive, he/she shall Pass an Eligibility Check. 3. Article 41.1 of the Constitution was also amended to ensure that the President and Executive Committee shall be re-elected only once for a four year term. However, the current term of the current President and the current Executive shall not be counted. 4. Article 23 was amended to increase the number of delegates/votes of Regional Football Associations and Allied Associations to 4 and 3 respectively. This was sequel to the decision of last year\u2019s AGM to increase the number of teams in the First and Second Divisions to 14 and 16 teams respectively effective in 2018/19 League Season. In order to create a balance in voting power of members, the 2016 AGM tasked a three man Task Force to work out a formula for the increment based on principle of proportionality. As a result, the first and second division clubs shall henceforth have a total of 30 votes, representing 41.10 percent of the total votes while the allied associations shall now have 15 votes, representing 20.55 percent and the regional football associations shall now have 28 votes, representing 38.36 percent of the total votes; increasing the Total Number of votes to 73. In the area of competition, the Meeting also approved the proposal of the Executive that effective 2018/19 Season, the champions of Lower River, Central River, North Bank and Upper River Regions will directly qualify to the Second Division of the National League, whilst those of Banjul, Kanifing Municipality and West Coast Region will compete in a triangular qualifier to fill the remaining One Spot for the Second Division. 5. The Meeting unanimously confirmed the decision of the Executive Committee to suspend Mr. Bakary Paco Dampha for blocking a GFF FF Cup match between Gamtel and Samger on April 8, 2017 at the Serekunda East Mini Stadium, and Mr. Lamin Jarju the defeated candidate for the presidency of the West Coast Region Football Association earlier this year, for taking a football matter before a civil court by suing the President and Secretary General of the said Regional Football Association. Both cases are considered to be very serious violations of the GFF Constitution. The duo was earlier suspended by the Executive Committee and it was the mandate of the General Assembly to validate or otherwise such decision. As required by Article 16.1 of the GFF Statute, the two cases were separately voted on and each passed with attaining the required two-thirds majority of the total votes cast. Thus upholding the suspension of the two gentlemen indefinitely, with Mr. Jarju having the option to withdraw the case from the court and his suspension lifted.\nThe members also renewed their support to the current leadership for the unprecedented strides that the national game has attained in recent years. They also unanimously condemned the actions of the National Sports Council/Ministry of Youth and Sports for meddling into the internal matters of the Federation. They also decried the latest attempt by some individuals to hide behind the National Assembly Select Committee on Sports to force the GFF to comply with an illegal process, even after an Executive intervention seemed to have broken the impasse. Describing the actions of these interest groups as selfish and becoming unbearable, members called for a stop to what they referred to as a witch-hunt and instead urged them to join hands with the GFF to develop the game in the country. Members also urged the Government, cum Ministry of Youth and Sports, to fulfil their commitments of sponsoring the national teams. The GFF President reassured the delegates that the position of the Executive, not to associate themselves with an illegitimate process, will never change irrespective of the circumstances. The event had earlier began with the President, Lamin Kaba Bajo\u2019s, introductory remark and the approval of the agenda followed by the adoption of last year\u2019s minutes. Mr. Bajo said the GFF under his leadership places a very high priority on articulating its core competency in good governance, sound financial management and genuine partnership with its stakeholders including, but not limited to, Government, Clubs, Affiliated Associations, WAFU, CAF and FIFA. He further remarked that the GFF have made concrete plans to move the game forward in terms of national football development, capacity building, grassroots and women football, regional leagues, national teams, infrastructure development, fund raising and marketing for a healthy financial standing.\n\u201cThe Plan also includes targets and milestones for implementing improved management information systems in the areas of finance, human resources and project management for the Regional Football Associations, which culminated with the hiring of Coaches and Administrative/Financial Secretaries at the Regional Football Associations,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartening to report that the furnishing of the GFF Hotel has been completed, the Senior Management Team is recruited, and a Board of Directors appointed to oversee the operations of the Hotel. I am pleased to inform you that the Hotel has since started operations, though at a small scale. If all goes well with the project, it will serve as a new source of income for the Federation which will greatly reduce our financial dependence on FIFA/CAF and the government, and also significantly reduce our expenditure in the camping of national teams and conducting of technical training programmes. This is a landmark achievement in the history of football administration in this country.\u201d\nDespite the above achievements, the President noted that the past year has been a very challenging one for the Federation notwithstanding due to the avoidable crisis that arose between the GFF and the National Sports Council. \u201cIt was unfortunate we were not giving the opportunity to familiarise ourselves and work with the new leadership of both the Ministry and NSC, instead we found ourselves in an unnecessary impasse, which has created tension and acrimony between us. As we have been saying throughout the impasse, we are not afraid of an investigation as our hands are clean and our conscience is clear as far as the handling of the funds of the funds and management of the Federation are concerned. All we were insisting on was the following of due process and that the actions of all should be dictated and guided by laws and existing rules and regulations, as we operate within the dictates of the GFF Constitution, the FIFA and CAF Statutes, and the national laws of the country,\u201d he emphasised.\nMr. Bajo added that despite the challenges, which ran over several weeks, peace has finally showed up her face when the Minister made a public statement calling for peace and reconciliation to enable bygones be bygones and that the purported investigations was being discontinued. He said he later held a successful meeting with Minister Gomez, where they both agreed to give peace a chance.", "article_link": "http://foroyaa.gm/gambia-football-federation-holds-agm/", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "2"}, "shares": "0"}

Bah\nDrivers plying the Brikama-Basse highway have decried the unusual crossing of cattle on the trans-Gambia main highway as animal distraction increases at an alarming rate. It has been noticed over the years that drivers knock down animals crossing the highway leading to cattle and even human fatalities. This reporter witnessed a near miss collision of a bus and a calf that was following some cows crossing the highway. This could have resulted in an accident if the driver did not miss the calf. According to the bus driver, it is a big risk when driving on the trans-Gambia highway nowadays as animals of all sort, cross the highway to reach water points; that most of the time, they have to make split-second diversions when they come across animals crossing the highway which they said lead some drivers in the wrong direction, and causing accidents.\nOne of the drivers called on livestock owners to keep their animals away from the road; that the Gambia Livestock Association should take the lead in making sure that animals are protected and kept domestically. He said drivers are always troubled psychologically and economically, when they hit animals as owners will sometimes claim cash or curse them. This the driver said, is a burning issue for drivers and called on the authorities to intervene so that they can carry on their noble work to carry people and goods safely.\nAnother \u201cGelle-gelle\u201d driver said he was lucky to have managed a near miss collision after spotting cattle from a distance; that otherwise he would have ran over them and probably kill or injure them or hurt his passengers; that donkeys are the main contributors to the high incidence of road accidents because they don\u2019t move away from the road when a vehicle approaches them. Muhammed Camara is a livestock owner living on the Bakadagi-Mankama Kunda road side. Camara said they are not to be blamed for not keeping their animals away from the road; that the settlement is known for animal rearing and drivers should be very cautious when driving around the area; that drivers will be responsible when they hit his animals because the area is a human settlement that has animals.\nAccording to him, it is difficult to pen the animals in a permanent place depriving them of their rights to movement and grazing; that animals sometimes need to be idle to fend for them themselves. Other animal owners express similar concerns. The major causes of accidents they said is the over speeding of the drivers.", "article_link": "http://foroyaa.gm/drivers-decry-frequent-animal-crossings-on-main-trans-gambia-highway/", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "1"}, "shares": "0"}

They should accurately be aware that this is not a threat but a reality.\"\nIn the address, Kim also expressed a desire for a peaceful resolution with South Korea, a break from the aggressive language he used to threaten the US.\nTrump, as part of his Tuesday morning tweetstorm, said the potentially warm gesture to South Korea from Kim is \"perhaps\" good news, \"perhaps not,\" and referred to \"sanctions and 'other' pressures\" on North Korea.\nPress secretary Sarah Sanders said at the White House news briefing that the US approach to North Korea had not changed, that the US continues to regard North Korea as a global threat and seeks an international solution while keeping \"all of our options on the table.\"\nTrump has repeatedly made statements about North Korea via Twitter. The President said it was a waste of time for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to negotiate with North Korea -- referring to Kim in the tweet as \"Little Rocket Man\" -- shortly after the US diplomat said he hoped to de-escalate the standoff through talks. After a North Korean statement insulted Trump by calling him a \"dotard,\" the US President tweeted that he would \"NEVER\" call the North Korean leader \"short and fat,\" while also saying that \"maybe someday\" he would be Kim's friend.\nSouth Korea initially receptive to possible dialogue\nRecent years have seen North Korea display increasing strength in its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile development, while Kim makes provocative statements threatening to attack his enemies. In November, North Korea claimed it had the capability to attack any part of the US mainland.\nThe UN Security Council has voted to ratchet up sanctions in response to the continued development of North Korea's nuclear program. Last month, the US conducted another round of military exercises with South Korea, which Kim called for South Korea to end in his New Year's statement.\nBut Kim's call for talks between the two countries at the beginning of the year struck many observers as noteworthy, and South Korean leadership has been receptive to Kim's potential openness to dialogue. The spokesman for South Korean President Moon Jae-in said South Korea also hoped for a resolution between the two countries.\nMoon said he would look to restore communication between the South and the isolated North, and that he welcomed North Korea participating in the Winter Olympic Games, which South Korea is hosting next month.

(Photo: Bio and Alie Kabba).\nSLPP needs to win at least 20% of votes in the north of the country, assuming it can maintain its 2012 majority of over 60% won in its political heartland \u2013 the southern half of the country.\nBut there are major challenges for SLPP in the capital Freetown and in the eastern district of Kono, where, since losing the 2007 elections it has struggled to make any impact \u2013 either at by-elections or general and local elections. SLPP currently has no single MP in those districts.\nBoth Freetown and Kono will be the most unpredictable and complex constituencies at the 2018 elections, with the highest percentage of swing voters in the country.\nThe ruling APC and the newly formed Coalition 4 Change party \u2013 led by the former vice president who was sacked by president Koroma in 2015 \u2013 Sam Sumana, are likely to take up most of the seats in Kono, with the SLPP trailing by a long margin.\nInvariably, people in Sierra Leone vote on tribal lines, and the opposition SLPP has a serious image problem which has dogged the party\u2019s chances of winning massive votes, especially in the north of the country.\nFar too many of Sierra Leone\u2019s voters perceive the SLPP as a party for the Mendes, despite a handful of northerners serving on the party\u2019s national executive.\nHundreds of SLPP party supporters and regional officials have left the party to join the NGC, including some of their senior party grandees \u2013 including Yasmine Jusu Sheriff, Isata Jabbie kabbah, Andrew Keili, and many others.\nSo, the choice of running mate by Maada Bio tomorrow, will determine the tribal or regional complexion of the SLPP\u2019s presidential campaign ticket. It will also indeed determine how seriously the SLPP\u2019s motto of \u201cOne Country \u2013 One People\u201d should be taken by the electorate.\nOver 60% of the voting population in Sierra Leone are Women, and are believed to be holding the winning card at next year\u2019s elections.\nBut the SLPP party is short of any experienced, high-profile national female figure they can count on. They have all deserted the party.\nWho Bio appoints as his presidential running mate tomorrow is anyone\u2019s guess.\nBut certainly, SLPP will need to do more than bridging the regional and gender gap in its leadership by appointing a northerner with a national appeal, as Maada Bio\u2019s running mate.\nMany in Sierra Leone say that Bio himself as an ex-military junta leader is tainted, and will struggle to win the confidence of the majority of voters on March 7, 2018.\nWill his running mate help make a difference to the electoral fortunes of the party? Only time will tell.", "article_link": "http://www.thesierraleonetelegraph.com/maada-bio-to-end-speculation-about-presidential-running-mate/", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "1"}, "shares": "0"}

The second most common reason given was that the added individual was in a position of authority and could affect the scholar\u2019s career \u2013 something that Dr Fong and Professor Wilhite said was \u201cmost disturbing\u201d.\nFemale academics were, on average, 38 per cent more likely than their male peers to have felt obliged to add an author to a manuscript, an issue that the report\u2019s authors attributed to \u201cthe dearth of other females\u201d in senior or leadership positions, leaving them with \u201cfewer mentors to help navigate these political minefields\u201d.\nMore junior academics were more likely to feel obliged to add an author, with assistant professors 90 per cent more likely to do so than full professors, and associate professors 40 per cent more likely.\nThe study also shows that the likelihood of academics feeling obliged to give additional credit varies a great deal between disciplines, with those publishing papers in marketing as much as 75 per cent more likely to do so than average. At the other end of the scale, political scientists were 44 per cent less likely to feel such pressure.\nDr Fong and Professor Wilhite found that 14.1 per cent of respondents reported having been coerced by a journal editor to add citations to their paper, most likely to improve the periodical\u2019s journal impact factor.\nIn this case, men were more likely to report having been coerced in this way (18 per cent more likely), and junior academics were more likely to be affected.\nIt is not just a matter of peer pressure, however: 20.8 per cent of respondents said that they had added an investigator to a grant proposal even though their contribution was minimal and, of these, 60.8 per cent said that they did this to improve the chances of their project getting funding.\nThe authors conclude that \u201cthere is a significant level of deception in authorship and citation research\u201d and that, \u201cwhile it would be na\u00efve to suppose that academics are above such scheming to enhance their position, the results suggest otherwise\u201d. The competition for research funding and journal space appears to make academics feel \u201ccompelled to participate in activities they find distasteful,\u201d the paper adds.\nSpeaking to Times Higher Education, Professor Wilhite suggested that the best way to eradicate misconduct is to give less incentive for it, for instance eliminating self-citations within the assessment of journal impact factor.\n\u201cAs the manipulation of citation metrics is increasingly well known, academics will express doubt in the validity of these measures,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my opinion, citation metrics do carry useful information and shouldn\u2019t just be rejected, but if they can be manipulated it renders them useless.\n\u201cInternal discussion of these issues on a university-by-university basis is needed, and there isn\u2019t a magic switch that will turn on or off such activities, but because it\u2019s tough to do doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be done.\u201d\n\u00a9 2018, The Chronicle of Education.

Yet public perception of science is positive with a majority (67%) in agreement that public policies should be based on the best available science.\nMore than half of Americans agree that scientists should play a major role in shaping public policy in many areas, not only in medical and health research, but also in education (58%), infrastructure (55%) and national defense (51%). The public overwhelmingly (82%) considers scientists trustworthy spokespersons for science, far above elected officials and the media. This level of trust includes an expectation that scientists will be the primary messengers for scientific issues, even those with policy implications. However, scientists remain essentially invisible. A very strong majority of Americans (81%) cannot name a living scientist, more than two-thirds (67%) cannot name an institution, company or organization where medical or health research is conducted, and less than a quarter (21%) know that medical research is conducted in all 50 states.\n\u201cThe findings related to the visibility of scientists and the scientific community have been consistent over the past decade\u2014woefully low\u2014which indicates a need for stronger engagement between scientists and the public,\u201d said Mary Woolley, president and CEO, Research!America. \u201cIn order for science to have a more prominent position in our national agenda, the public and their policymakers must hear more from scientists about the health and economic benefits of public and private sector research.\u201d\nOpinions were mixed (46% agree, 33% disagree and 22% not sure) about whether or not great strides in science and innovation will continue while Donald Trump is president. The responses were divided along party lines with more Republicans (74%) than Independents (44%) and Democrats (22%) agreeing. Furthermore, a significant number of Americans (79%), including strong majorities across the political spectrum, agree that it is important for President Trump to assign a high priority to putting health research and innovation to work to assure continued medical progress (85% of Democrats, 79% of Republicans and 72% of Independents). A strong majority of Americans (71%) say they have confidence in scientific institutions compared to 46% for the Presidency and 31% for Congress. In 2018, all 435 seats in the House and 33 of 100 Senate seats will be up for election.\n\u201cScientists must initiate productive conversations with candidates to connect the dots between research and finding solutions to health threats like Alzheimer\u2019s disease and the opioid epidemic,\u201d said Woolley.\nA majority of Americans (60%) support increased funding for research to better understand and combat opioid addiction, and a plurality (45%) say prescription pain medication abuse and addiction is a major problem in their community. In a survey of West Virginians, respondents said the opioid epidemic is the most important health issue in the state, above obesity, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and dental disease.\n\u00a9 2018, The Chronicle of Education.

that even as we look to a brighter year of 2018, may we never return to such paths which greatly plundered our beloved country into untold misery, insecurity, human rights abuse, economic hardship and many more aspects not favorable for the growth and furtherance of democracy in our fatherland .\nGreat Nations shall forever be great Nations because they remain strong, solid, conscious and true to their own history and this great Nation called Cameroon which is abundantly blessed and rich in cultural diversity, on both banks of the Mungo, reminds us of our very unique story that makes both the citizen and the Nation great at the same time.\nIn the face of a tensed socio-economic and political atmosphere, the authorities are still encroaching on public freedoms: Cameroon has witnessed the longest Internet cut in history, a time also characterized by the violation of fundamental human rights by our security forces.\nThe emigration of young people appeared under the shameful face of the reduction of our children to slavery, far from home especially in the Maghreb and without us being able to do much, we are challenged by the drama of a system so weak that it has succumbed to both the expected and unexpected in the life of a State.\nThe tragedy of worn-out infrastructures makes daily life and activities extremely difficult: little or no access to transport facilities, little or no decent place for habitation, shortage of power supply and Water, a lockdown on the health and no availability of a social security system put in place to make retirement and old age enviable, talkless of the educational sector which produces certificates not often regarded as sufficient to Sit for entry into examination boards of other countries of the world .\nIn 2017 we witnessed a people not in-touch with their representatives whom they elected , a complete split between the people and the governing elite, with the latter being unable to satisfy the basic social aspirations of the former.\nDiligent men and women of our country have fought without resilience, for the system to work for them in their daily lives but our country is essentially lagging on all fronts in the face of a competitive Africa with countries such as Ghana, Tanzania, Kenya and Nigeria working hard to eradicate corruption and under-development and although Cameroon holds a leading role in Central Africa\u2019s economy, social and political domains, much is expected of us to move our region and sub-regions forward.\nThe economic crisis has lasted, oh yes, it has!\nTaxes levied on the people are appalling and embarrassing, even as we find ourselves in the grip of a new structural adjustment plan imposed by the International Monetary Fund, our economy has greatly suffered severe lags, losses and non accountability for public funds; expenditures, loans and Co.\nLooking back at 2017 with a heavy heart full of tears, I remember all our brothers who fell on the battle field while so fiercely defending the colors and integrity of our country; Cameroon, others who have fallen by road and sea accidents, natural causes of death and others.\nAt this juncture, I pray for the many bereaved families, our brave and young soldiers gone too soon during attacks by the Islamic group; Boko Haram and also during the Anglophone Crises in the South West and North West of our country.\nToday is 2018, and it\u2019s time to rebuild from our old ruins, it\u2019s time to construct and reconstruct real time bridges; routes that will be instrumental in encouraging men and women of valor from this great Nation to invest and get involved not only in the Socio-Economic process of growth but they must also exercise their civic rights such as voting and taking part in other political processes which would be a determinant of the executive and legislative bodies of our beloved country; Cameroon.\nIt is indeed time for every illustrious son and daughter of Cameroon to rise up in their communities and domains; be it national or the international, to contribute each and everyone their humble quotas in time to save our Great and Beautiful Nation.\nIt is indeed time to repair the pains, time to forgive, time to love again and believe in each other, time to eradicate the canker-worms that are threatening the continuity of our State, jealously enshrined and honored in the Preamble of the Cameroonian constitution.\nIt is indeed a time for the reinstatement of the Human Dignity and the respect of Human Rights in Cameroon by the officials that be, so that every Cameroonian can once more feel that sense of belonging, security, protection from his/her Fatherland.\nIt is indeed time for the Cameroonian authorities to hold a frank Dialogue on the Anglophone crises with stakeholders of the civil society, the clergy and representatives of political parties who are regarded and considered by the masses, with issues such as the Cameroonian refugees in the neighboring state of Cross Rivers to be resolved with immediate effect.\nIt is indeed time for peace and love and for the pride of being Cameroonians to re-ignited, especially at a time when our international image has often been undermined.

Members of our defence and security forces were assassinated in cold blood in the line of duty\u201d\nThe head of state went further to congratulate the defence and security forces on the bravery, determination, restraint and professionalism they have demonstrated thus far.\nThe president, as many others have been saying for a long time now, also prescribed dialogue to solve the current crisis but said it must be within legality.\n\u201cI should make it very clear that, to my mind, dialogue has always been and will always remain the best means of resolving problems, so long as it is strictly in line with republican legality\u201d, President Biya added.\nWhile many political pundits have been quick to observe that the president tone during his current address was less confrontational that that of December 31, 2016, others also noticed the president\u2019s failure to use lines like \u2018One and indivisible Cameroon\u2019, \u2018Form of state is non-negotiable\u2019, being words that have marked the political dictionary of the nation over the just ended year.\nAlso interestingly, the president did not call those he describes as fanning violence in the North West and South West regions \u201cTerrorists\u201d, as was the case on the day he declared war against \u2018Anglophone terrorist\u2019 at the airport upon arrival from Abidjan, Ivory Coast. The president preferred milder words like \u2018Criminals\u2019 and \u2018Secessionists\u2019.\nReacting to the president\u2019s New Year address, the Chairman of the leading opposition party, SDF, Ni John Fru Ndi, accused the president of failing to personally supervise dialogue in the Anglophone regions.\nHe accused the president of being the real secessionist, evidenced in the way he has handled the crisis. \u201cHow can you declare war on an unarmed people and restrict internet for months in the North West and South West regions\u201d, Fru Ndi demanded while saying that Mr. Biya is only concerned about military deaths and is yet to acknowledge civilian deaths by the military.\nSisiku Ayuk Julius says self defense is a universal human right\nSpeaking through social media, the self-declared President of the virtual Federal Republic of Ambazonia, Sisiku Ayuk Julius Tabe, who had hitherto condemned killings on both sides, announced his support for the separatist fighters across the North West and South West regions.\n\u201cThis Interim Government stands with the youths and supports them because self-defense is a universal human right protected under the charters of the United Nations. The forces of occupation in our territory, especially those deployed in Mamfe and the rest of Manyu are suddenly realizing that no matter how equipped and trained an army can be, it cannot break the will of a people who have been incessantly deprived of human dignity and freedoms\u201d, Sisiku Ayuk Julius said.", "article_link": "http://thesuncameroon.cm/index.php/2018/01/03/biyas-end-year-message-war-separatists-continueswithout-excesses/", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "2"}, "shares": "0"}

Pregnant women also received gifts as she said they should be celebrated because they were the ones who bring life into this world.\nRead more:\n\u201cThe problem of orphaned, abandoned and vulnerable children, women, and girls is close to my heart. It is a problem that is not unique to Zimbabwe, but goes beyond our borders, regionally and internationally. However, the fact that it is a common problem is not a justification for us to let the situation worsen,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAs Zimbabweans, closely knitted family structures are a vital part of our culture. Surely, we are all relatives of these children. Most of us have the capacity to accommodate them. We can take them in within our homes. Adoption is also an option that we have and we should demystify and embrace it. There is no need to fear and remain in ignorance. We should educate each other and remove the myths and unfounded social cultural beliefs that hinder us from talking care of our own.\u201d\nThe First Lady said children\u2019s homes came about as a result of instances where parents did not have the capacity to take care of their children and opted for better care in the homes.\nShe said the growing number of children\u2019s homes in the country was a cause for concern, which needed a collective solution.\n\u201cWhat is saddening is that some of these children are mentally challenged or disabled, requiring special care. These homes are regarded as a last resort, hence their increasing numbers is now a major concern. We should collectively interrogate the push factors and explore preventive mechanisms. The mere existence of the 14 children\u2019s homes here in Manicaland to me is the initial indication of a desire to provide for children\u2019s needs although it is in an alternate setting from the traditional family set-up,\u201d she said.\nShe commended the efforts of the children\u2019s homes in the province and encouraged them to continue raising independent, disciplined, respectable ambitious and capable individuals.\nThe First Lady\u2019s visit is part of nationwide visits she has been conducting to acquaint herself with issues pertaining to the social sector.\n\u201cThis is driven not only by my portfolio as the First Lady, but my passion for socio-transformation and improvement of livelihoods as a mother. I believe that going personally to meet the people and seeing first hand their predicament is the effective mechanism that will make one understand the people\u2019s needs and the existing gaps that require intervention,\u201d she said.\nShe called on those who run orphanages to ensure that the children they raise experience the same childhood as those in traditional family set-ups.\nSpeaking at the same occasion, Minister of State for Manicaland Provincial Affairs, Senator Monica Mutsvangwa, said: \u201cThe visit to this place shows that you (First Lady Mnangagwa) value these children.\n\u201cIf they are valued, they will also have a sense of self-worth, which is important for them to grow up into confident adults.\u201d\nSen Mutsvangwa said Manicaland should utilise the abundant vast natural resources available in the province to take care of the orphaned children.\n\u201cIf we do this, we can take care of our children and there will be no children who do not go to school. For us to succeed, we should use what we have and be able to take care of these children and change their lives for better,\u201d she said.", "article_link": "http://www.herald.co.zw/first-lady-donates-to-14-childrens-homes/", "comments": "36", "reactions": {"likes": "123"}, "shares": "6"}

Bah, the Minister of Tourism and Culture, said 62% of all the bookings in the world are based on \u2018All-Inclusive Tourism\u2019; that it has become necessary that the tourism sector cannot go against the trend that obtains in the world.\nMr. Bah was responding to a question from Hon. Ousman Sillah, National Assembly Member (NAM) for Banjul North, on the concerns expressed by small scale operators in the tourism sector regarding the introduction of the \u2018all-inclusive\u2019 tourism package. According to the small scale operators, the package does not favour them; that it does not have that trickle-down effect in terms of the tourists having access to their products. Mr. Bah said there are problems because people find it difficult to adjust to change.\n\u201cWe have been staggering for 52 years with nothing more than 150, 000 arrivals in this country. As a Government we owe it to the people to revise that figure. If countries like Cape Verde can boast of 800, 000 arrivals and working towards 1 million guests, a great country like the Gambia with beautiful beaches and natural beauties, a good cultural heritage and other landmarks, should be able to sell this country and attract more guests.\u201d\nHe said the sector and stakeholders operating within the sector, need to adopt new norms in order to achieve their target of 500, 000 tourists.\n\u201cWe would not allow few Gambians to go against the interest of the majority,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Bah posited.\nThe tourism minister also responded to the issue of Gambians being denied access to the beach; that the security is too harsh and need to liberalise this; that there is a misunderstanding with a change in policy by the Ministry of Interior replacing the trained personnel, with new untrained ones; that they cannot train the others when the season is already on. Mr. Bah said they must be given time to trained others to be able to handle the security situation in the tourism area.\nMr. Bah said the image of this country matters to them and their tour in Europe revealed that there is no family tourism, including children, because the Gambia was designated as a place for sex tourism.\n\u201cWe have to fight this tooth and nail. Some of these people are complaining that they are denied access and they have massage huts or parlours and they keep girls in those so called massages parlours,\u201d he said.\nMr. Bah said these girls are used to sell themselves to tourists in those \u201cso-called parlours\u201d on the beach.\nHe promised that they are working on a package to get tourist taxi drivers\u2019 good vehicles and to support and enable them stay in business.", "article_link": "http://foroyaa.gm/all-inclusive-a-must-in-our-tourism-sector-hamat-bah/", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "1"}, "shares": "0"}

Mendy is the first Gambian to be voted as Bishop of the country.\nHundreds of the Christian faithful belonging to the Roman Catholic Diocese, family members and well-wishers, assembled at the Airport to welcome their new Bishop-elect.\nUpon arrival at the airport, Bishop-elect Gabriel Mendy said he has come to continue the good job of the retired bishop; that the Catholic Church in the whole world is the same family and therefore no change should be expected from him. \u201cI am happy and I am always happy to be in the Gambia as I am part of the country. I look forward to this big task ahead of me and I really believe that God will give me the wisdom to be able to lead his flock through the right path,\u201d he said. He said the Gambia never had its own bishop in sixty years after being a diocese of its own; that with the help of the priests and other religious leaders, he is sure of achieving the aims of the Church as Bishop.\nIt could be recalled that on November 30th 2017, Rev. Gabriel was announced as the new bishop of Banjul, following the retirement request of the Rt. Rev. Robert Patrick Ellison, the current Bishop of Banjul. Bishop-elect Rev. Gabriel Mendy has returned to take over this leadership of the Catholic Church in The Gambia. The Christian community especially the Catholics who anticipated his arrival, welcomed their Bishop in their numbers at the airport.\nThe appointment of Rev. Mendy as Catholic Bishop of Banjul, has been greeted with joy by Gambians and Catholics all over the world. The new bishop will be ordained on the 3rd February 2018, at the Independence Stadium and a huge congregation comprising mainly Christians including Muslims, is expected to grace this auspicious occasion.", "article_link": "http://foroyaa.gm/first-gambian-bishop-arrives-home-to-assume-office/", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "3"}, "shares": "0"}

This was after the previous holder Edward Soluku stepped down to contest his old parliamentary seat in Moyamba.\nShe is now going to focus on strengthening her party\u2019s standing in the Southern Province, where her party is facing some level of threats from traditional APC rival, as well as the newly formed political coalitions of Dr. Kandeh Yumkella and Alhaji Musa Tarawallie.\nMrs. Emma Kowa-Jalloh has a formidable task ahead. But she has repeatedly shown that she is a woman of substance.\nIn the 2012 elections, Emma Kowa scored 91.3% of the votes in her Bo District Constituency. She got the highest percentage ever by an SLPP MP in those elections and nationwide. She was only beaten in percentage of votes scored by Tonkollili\u2019s Mabinty Fornah, who scored 94.5% of votes in her constituency.\nThroughout her two terms in Parliament, Emma Kowa was a reliable activist for gender equality and empowerment of women.\nBy being elevated to such a high position, Emma Kowa becomes the second ever female politician to head the regional operations of a major political party in Sierra Leone.\nCongratulations to Mrs. Emma Kowa-Jalloh. This is an appointment worth celebrating by women, no matter their individual political persuasion.\nLadies, we will continue to push the Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment (GE-WE) momentum higher and higher in Sierra Leone.\nWe now patiently sit and wait to see how seriously the various political party leaders are going to take the importance of giving their party symbols to their capable female members, so as to enable MORE WOMEN to contest parliamentary seats in SAFE CONSTITUENCIES within the traditional political strongholds of their respective parties.\nIndicative data around the world shows that more women in politics means better politics, and also means faster development.\nIn Sierra Leone, women make up more than 52% of the registered voters. Gender equality and women empowerment is definitely going to be on the campaign agenda in the coming 2018 Elections in Sierra Leone.\nEditor\u2019s Note:\nYou can watch Emma Kowa speaking about women empowerment in Sierra Leone here:", "article_link": "http://www.thesierraleonetelegraph.com/sierra-leone-gets-second-woman-to-ever-head-a-political-partys-regional-operations/", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "1"}, "shares": "0"}

He promised them that under his leadership, Kono will be transformed into the mecca it was during the glory days.\nBut all this was just political posturing, A few years into his presidency, he unveiled his true colour. He made the office of the Vice President irrelevant, by first of all distancing himself from his vice president before relieving him of most of his state functions.\nWhilst this was going on, and the Kono people were fully divided, fighting amongst themselves and not paying attention, he continued to support his mining interest in Kono through the various subsidiary companies, the he the President created.\nAfter the Vice President Sam Sumana was finally deposed in a palace coup in March 2015, the President set his sights on getting rid of the young and dynamic Mayor of Kono.\nThe mayor of Kono was regarded by many as simply fighting mining companies for royalty rights and against all kinds of immoral practices, such as mining in and around the city and using explosives to blow up rocks, which has the tendency of undermining the structural foundation of buildings.\nThe only person who benefited from all these shenanigans is President Koroma. My surprise though is that, renowned citizens, such as David Tam Bayoh, who appeared to have guessed what President Koroma was up to at the beginning, was also compromised.\nDiana Konomanyi and the rest of the sycophants used in this diabolical plan should be rejected by the people of Kono, because they are self-serving.\nMy hope is that the people of Kono will use their votes to destroy the APC, and finally put to rest the clich\u00e9 that we Kono people are stupid and can be bought and manipulated.", "article_link": "http://www.thesierraleonetelegraph.com/the-people-of-kono-must-use-their-votes-to-remove-apc-from-office-in-2018/", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "0"}, "shares": "0"}

Those whose husbands take fat salaries from the mining company perhaps could afford the cost of delivery by a trained midwife. The midwife wants as many as six Geisha soaps among other which we cannot afford; we don\u2019t bath Geisha soaps so we prefer the TBA who won\u2019t ask for expensive soaps\u201d Madam Theresa Hukpatsi said.\nSometimes, labour normally occurred at night and getting a vehicle to the health center or clinic becomes a challenge.\nWayforward\nThe District Health Facilities must urgently review the items requested from expectant mothers during labour and standardize it for all health facilities in the district.\nAn in-service training on inter-personal relations for the midwives could help get more skilled deliveries.\nHealth education strategies are required to increase community awareness about the importance of skilled delivery and the education programmes must also lure attention on relatives and friends of pregnant women since they play central role in the decision of place of delivery.\nFor good health care delivery to be efficient in the health system in the country, midwives and the nurses must be friendly to their clients so that they can be free to report any challenge they may be going through at all times.\nMaternal death is becoming alarming in recent times that one would wonder if getting pregnant is important because of some complications during child birth.\nSome circles have attributed maternal death to witch craft whilst others attribute it to the negligence of some health practitioners during delivery.\nChild birth is important in our African society; it brings joy, love, bond between child and mother, adds to the number of people in a family among others.\nMaternal death is defined by World Health Organization (WHO) as \u201cthe death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes\u201d.\nAccording to WHO globally, from 1990 \u2013 2015, there has been a reduction in maternal deaths worldwide of about 45%.

Adequate warmth should be provided for the newborns.\nPostnatal\nExclusive breastfeeding, attaching importance to the colostrum.\nCord care with appropriate medication (methylated spirit or chlorhexidine).\nMother should wash her hands always before handling of baby.\nBook Launch\nRecently at a book launch on \u201cwhy do some women persistently prefer traditional birth attendants and domiciliary delivery\u201d( domicilary delivery, is the delivery of a range of personal care and support services to the individual in their own homes) a qualitative study on delivery care services in Chirano and Bekwai sub-districts in the Bibiani Anhwiaso Bekwai district of the western region\u201d explains that a lot of women in the rural areas prefer the Traditional Birth Attendants (TBA) throughout their childbirth.\nBetween 2008-2013 TBAs had 76% of deliveries in Chirano sub-district, in the Western Region, at Humjibre (a small community located in the Bibiani Ahwiaso Bekwai), 23% deliveries took place at the Humjibre clinic, 36% at other health facilities (outside Humjibre) and then 41% happening under the supervision of TBAs.\nThe study explored factors existing in the communities that promote TBA or domiciliary delivery and factors existing at the health facilities that hinder increased supervised delivery as well as evaluate the attractive roles of the TBAs that make some pregnant persistently use them.\nFindings from the study indicates that;\n92 representing 53% of them used only TBAs throughout their childbirth (out of which 75 (82%) were multigravidas (a woman who has been pregnant for more than once) and 17 (18%) being primigravidas (a woman pregnant for the first time).\nAnother 47 (27%) participants who were multigravidas used both skilled and TBAs while the remaining 34 (20%) participants used\nskilled delivery throughout childbirths.\nObed Bangdome Ofori, author of the book and also a staff at the Western Regional Public Health Division of the Ghana Health Service said findings from the studies indicates that;\nDelivery costs with a midwife at health care facility or clinic were perceived unaffordable.\nThis was motivated by the low economic status of the community members. \u201cBrother, everybody in this world likes good things but we don\u2019t have money. Those whose husbands take fat salaries from the mining company perhaps could afford the cost of delivery by a trained midwife. The midwife wants as many as six Geisha soaps among other which we cannot afford; we don\u2019t bath Geisha soaps so we prefer the TBA who won\u2019t ask for expensive soaps\u201d Madam Theresa Hukpatsi said.\nSometimes, labour normally occurred at night and getting a vehicle to the health center or clinic becomes a challenge.\nWayforward\nThe District Health Facilities must urgently review the items requested from expectant mothers during labour and standardize it for all health facilities in the district.\nAn in-service training on inter-personal relations for the midwives could help get more skilled deliveries.\nHealth education strategies are required to increase community awareness about the importance of skilled delivery and the education programmes must also lure attention on relatives and friends of pregnant women since they play central role in the decision of place of delivery.\nFor good health care delivery to be efficient in the health system in the country, midwives and the nurses must be friendly to their clients so that they can be free to report any challenge they may be going through at all times.", "article_link": "https://thebftonline.com/business/maternal-health-should-be-a-concern-for-all/", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "4"}, "shares": "0"}

It is true that some mechanism must pay for this service when it is eventually availed as free service to the identified patients,\u201d said Dr Gwinji.\nDr Gwinji said Government, together with its partners, had over the years strategised and built support for the care of children under five years and pregnant women.\nHe said the main issues in addressing these challenges had always been provision of medical commodities.\n\u201cThe Health Levy, dedicated to commodities like medicines and surgical sundries, has come in to further strengthen this position,\u201d said Dr Gwinji.\nHe said this year, the health sector also got a better budgetary allocation compared to previous years, which he said would enable the free user-fee policy to become a reality.\n\u201cPutting all this together, we feel we have gone over the threshhold where we really can support the categories (the elderly, pregnant women and children under five) with access to service as per Government policy,\u201d he said.\nMedicines, vaccines and other consumables worth over $11 million have already been ordered.\nDr Gwinji said Government would however continue to advocate for adequate funding for social welfare to enable the health sector to effectively assist other patients outside these categories but were unable to meet the costs of medical care.\nDr Gwinji said going forward, if the current health financing policy was supported, it could create further opportunities for sustainable health care financing through diverse sources of revenue spelt out in the policy.\nThe health financing policy gave birth to cellphone taxation and has other suggestions for mobilisation of domestic financial resources.\nHealth institutions contacted for comment on the scrapping of the user-fee policy said they had already effected the directive.\nHarare Central Hospital chief executive officer Mrs Peggy Zvavamwe said: \u201cSo far, everything is going on well and we have been assured that we will also get extra allocations to cover costs of these identified patients, who are no longer paying for medical care.\u201d\nShe concurred with Dr Gwinji that medicines and medical sundries consumed the bulk of their budgets and that should Government meet these costs for the vulnerable groups, the burden would be lighter for health institution in the country.\nCommunity Working Group of Health executive director Mr Itai Rusike said while the free user-fee policy had always been in place, its implementation got mixed at various levels of care.\nHe said in some instances, patients would receive free consultation fees but would have to pay for medicines or other required services.\nMr Rusike implored Government to increase funding for health including grants, for the country to effectively implement its policies.\nMore Stories:", "article_link": "http://www.chronicle.co.zw/govt-to-use-health-levy-on-vital-medicines/", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "3"}, "shares": "0"}

The discussion was very engaging; listeners called in and we are happy that at least the three were brave enough to face the people,\u201d said Mr Phiri.\n\u201cThe three gentlemen have only been in office for a short period compared to other MPs as their entry into Parliament was due to a by election\u201d.\nHe encouraged other MPs and councillors to come forward and interact with the people who voted them into power.\nIn separate interviews, Cdes Tshuma and Malaba said the engagement was also a learning curve for residents who were not familiar with Parliamentary issues.\n\u201cOne of my short term goals was to make sure we represent the people of Bulawayo in Parliament whose needs were often ignored. I remember there was a time when people were starving but the Government was distributing maize to rural folk. I stood my ground in Parliament and eventually people in\nBulawayo started receiving food,\u201d said Cde Tshuma.\n\u201cI also help residents do short term projects like welding, mushroom farming and painting to generate quick income. We also capacitated vendors while we wait for industries to open.\u201d\nCde Tshuma said the greatest challenge was the unavailability of the Constituency Development Fund which hindered development in most communities.\n\u201cWe are glad that those funds will be released this month and we will try to invest in income generating projects so that it goes a long way for my constituents. I also think people should be taught the role of legislators in their communities as many people think we always have to attend funerals and fix burst sewer systems,\u201d he said. Pumula legislator Cde Godfrey Malaba said he was happy to have interacted with his constituents on air.\n\u201cAs one of my good works, I managed to help the community have access to water and electricity especially those in Habek area where residents had gone for a long time without those facilities,\u201d said Cde Malaba.\nSkyz Metro FM has invited members of the National Assembly, Senators and councillors from the city to its station to explain what they have worked on in their areas since they were elected in 2013 after complaints by listeners during its Vuka Vuka Show hosted by Babongile Sikhonjwa from 6AM to 10AM.@thamamoe .\nMore Stories:", "article_link": "http://www.chronicle.co.zw/bulawayo-legislators-take-up-accountability-challenge-on-air/", "comments": "8", "reactions": {"likes": "24"}, "shares": "2"}

He said: \u201cI think that\u2019s quite obvious to everybody. The opposition is nowhere near ready for elections. The MDC Alliance has potential, but has not put its act together.\u201d\nMr Cross reiterated remarks he made on his blog on Christmas, writing off the opposition and expressing confidence in President Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019s leadership. The post read, in part: \u201cMnangagwa is in absolute control of the State and I think he is going to deliver. One of the key elements behind this strategy is that he knows the opposition is in shambles.\n\u201c. . .

There are absolutely no disagreements in the MDC-T regarding the MDC Alliance.\n\u201cThere is a lot of fake news that is being generated by misguided elements, particularly on social media. We are not worried one bit about these purveyors of fake news since we are already on a roll.\u201d The MDC Alliance is in the throes of power struggles, with the latest ignited by a plan to allocate parliamentary constituencies which each party will run for come 2018.\nMDC-T secretary-general Mr Douglas Mwonzora torched the storm by announcing that his party had begun selecting candidates.

Digital art or new media art, which makes use of digital technology in its creation and presentation has had a huge impact on traditional art forms that include painting, drawing and sculpture.\nIn the past, art exhibitions were characterised by oil on canvas paintings, pencil drawings and sculptures but the digital age has brought in new elements such as virtual reality displays among many other techy installations.\nThe local art scene is not being left out. A number of digital art exhibitions are taking place throughout the country. Recently, Batanai Gardens played host to Dananayi Muwangiwa\u2019s RIMI Digital Arts and Augmented Reality Exhibition, which was a huge success in all regards.\nThis happens to be one of the many digital art exhibitions that are taking place every now and then locally. Speaking to The Sunday Mail Society on the sidelines of the exhibition, Muwangiwa shed more light on his craft.\n\u201cBasically I\u2019m a digital artiste, working primarily in a virtual space, so technically I use a computer to make art as opposed to drawing using a pencil or painting on canvas using oil,\u201d he explains.\n\u201cI make my paintings in Photoshop, making use of a drawing tablet for the drawing and painting but for the actual animation and the augmented reality, I animate in aftereffects and then I use unity and euphoria to cap it off. After I\u2019m done with the art pieces, I print them on fabriano paper, which keeps the colours accurate and has a unique texture to it.\u201d\nDigital art has without doubt expanded the artist\u2019s tools from the traditional raw materials into the sophisticated realm of electronic gadgets and software.\nHowever, Muwangiwa notes some people are still sceptical about the legitimacy of digital art but still has faith that more people will start accepting it.\n\u201cI am hoping that digital art will be more accepted within the traditional art community because I don\u2019t think this is a deviation from traditional art, I just think this is art. It\u2019s not like you can literally tell the computer to draw for you or paint for you because you still have to apply yourself and use your creativity to create the artwork,\u201d he argues.\nUnlike other forms of art, it seems like the digital sphere is for the tech-savvy. One needs massive know-how to be able to manoeuvre around the software maze, which will result in the creation of the final product.\nBut the growth of digital art in the country can generally be attributed to a populace that tries to stay abreast with global technological trends.\n\u201cThe digital art space in Zimbabwe has been growing because you will realise that there are many young artists who are using technology to make art. I am actually excited about augmented reality and what it can do because I think it\u2019s an untapped market or rather playing field and I feel like the sooner we can get into it, the better.\u201d\nAugmented reality is a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are \u201caugmented\u201d by computer-generated or extracted real-world sensory input such as sound, video, graphics, haptics or GPS data.\nWhile this might seem like too much wizardry to take in, these are some of the terms that one has to grasp in order to understand the route visual art has taken in this day and age. In a separate interview, another artist, Miriro Mwandiyambira, said digital art was progressive and something worth exploring. She, however, notes patience is needed for people to get used to the idea.\n\u201cChange is something that might not be easy to grasp, so I think it will take time for the local art community to start accepting this art form. It all comes down to the societal readiness to embrace the use of technology in the visual arts sector,\u201d said Mwandiyambira.\n\u201cDigital art might be the in-thing around the globe at the moment but on the local front we still have a long way to go because of a huge technological knowledge gap that exists between us and developed societies. Besides, art is still a lesser consumed product in Africa so there is still more that needs to be done for more people to be drawn to the craft.\u201d\nBut whether the public is ready to embrace the digital movement or not, one thing for certain is technology keeps advancing and local artistes have keenly opened up to new art forms.\nMore Stories:", "article_link": "http://www.sundaymail.co.zw/welcome-to-the-world-of-digital-art/", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "2"}, "shares": "0"}

Ethiopian Airlines flies into Victoria Falls from Addis Ababa four times a week while Kenyan Airways plies the Nairobi-Victoria Falls-Cape Town route three times a week.\nSouth African Airlink also flies into Victoria Falls from Cape Town six times a week, resulting in huge appetite by air travellers to visit one of the world\u2019s Seven Wonders.\nIn emailed responses, CAAZ told The Sunday Mail Business that the upgrading of the Victoria Falls International Airport to allow it to accommodate wide-bodied aircraft types and more passenger capacity, has already seen South African Airways upgrading its aircraft equipment from March 1, 2017 to a 222-seater Airbus A330-200. The aircraft replaced the 138-seater A320.\n\u201cConsequently, the airport has witnessed a 28 percent growth in passenger traffic from 222 967 during the period January to October 2016 to 284 330 during the same period in 2017,\u201d said CAAZ.\nThere is stiff competition for tourists between Zimbabwe and Zambia in Victoria Falls. Neighbouring Zambia also commissioned new radar equipment and a new terminal at the Harry Mwaanga Nkumbula (former Livingstone Airport) on December 23 last year, to make the airport more compelling and try to match the improvements at Victoria Falls.\nThe Harry Mwaanga Nkumbula Airport, which claims to be closest to the Victoria Falls, has capacity to process 700 000 passengers per year while the Victoria Falls Airport now has potential to handle 1,6 million passengers. The refurbishment of the Victoria Falls Airport, funded by China Eximbank, also entailed construction of a new four-kilometre runway.\nChairperson of the Hospitality Association of Zimbabwe (HAZ) Victoria Falls chapter Mr Christopher Svovah told The Sunday Mail Business that the surge in passenger arrivals has translated to a 59 percent rise in hotel occupancy levels from January to November 30, 2017.\n\u201cIndeed, passenger arrivals have gone up in 2017 from 2016 mainly due to the new Victoria Falls International Airport that was commissioned in November 2016, which has seen Kenya Airways, Ethiopian Airlines and SA Airlink now landing into Victoria Falls for the first time. And South African Airways managed to put the cherry on the cake by unveiling the Airbus A330, which has a capacity of 222 passengers.\n\u201cThen again, in December 2016 the Univisa was launched, which now allows entry or exit of tourists from 65 countries in Group B of the visa regime in both Zimbabwe and Zambia using the visa obtained either side of these two countries.\n\u201cAll these factors have seen occupancy for the hotels in the destination rising from 48 percent in 2016 to 59 percent in 2017, an 11 percent increase as most of these visitors would need accommodation as they tour the length and breadth of Victoria Falls. We are happy that the issue of destination accessibility and connectivity has finally been addressed,\u201d said Mr Svovah.\nIn the half year to June 30, 2017, Rainbow Tourism Group (RTG) recorded a 2 percent growth in revenue from $11,4 million in 2016 to $11,6 million in 2017 driven by the performance of its two hotels in Victoria Falls. RTG\u2019s two Victoria Falls hotels \u2013 A\u2019Zambezi River Lodge and Victoria Falls Rainbow \u2013 posted a 13 percent (US$339 000) growth in revenues compared to the same period in 2016.\n\u201cThis reflects the huge growth potential the region acquired as a result of increased flight seats in Victoria Falls following the opening of the Victoria Falls International Airport in 2016. Revenues from foreign guests continued on an upward trajectory registering a 9 percent growth to $3,8 million from $3,5 million recorded during the comparable period in 2016,\u201d said RTG chairman Mr John Chikura.\nLast year, African Sun Limited projected a 40 percent rise in weekly airline seat arrivals into Victoria Falls, spurred by the commissioning of the new airport.\nAirline seat arrivals measure the number of passengers carried by airlines. As a result of the commissioning of the airport, Victoria Falls is now connected to major regional capitals such as Lusaka, Luanda, Windhoek, Gaborone, Pretoria and Maputo. A United States luxury and lifestyle travel magazine, Conde Nast Traveller, named Zimbabwe the best destination for travellers to Africa in 2017.\nConcerns over pricing\nDespite the endorsement of the destination, concerns still linger over the pricing regime of the local tourism product. The use of a strong US dollar as a unit of exchange compared to weaker regional currencies, mainly the Zambian kwacha, is eating into the country\u2019s competitiveness.\nReports suggest Zambia is currently the biggest beneficiary of the boom in tourist arrivals. It is understood that tourists stay in Livingstone, Zambia, and only cross the Zambezi River to have a better view of the Victoria Falls from the Zimbabwean side.\nOn average, bed and breakfast costs US$200 in three to five-star hotels in Victoria Falls, while the charge is between US$45 and US$180 in Livingstone. Prices of food and beverages are also affordable in Livingstone compared to Victoria Falls (Zimbabwe side). Crucially, during this festive season, most hotels and lodges in Livingstone had massive discounts, something that is alien to local businesspeople.\nBut Mr Svovah said while they occasionally have promotions to attract more visitors, the cost of doing business in the country is higher than its regional competitors.\n\u201cA lot of players normally come up with packages and promotions to lure business but you will appreciate the fact that the rates being charged by the players are necessitated by the high costs along the value chain. The rate so charged is a build-up along the whole production process and reducing these would not make the business viable,\u201d said Mr Svovah.\nVictoria Falls has the highest capacity both at the airport and in hotels compared to its regional competition \u2013 Kasane and Livingstone. Hotels are fully booked and some enterprising hoteliers had to put up tents at their facilities to accommodate some of the tourists.\nIn Livingstone, most hotels were are also full.", "article_link": "http://www.sundaymail.co.zw/vic-falls-passenger-traffic-up-28pc/", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "13"}, "shares": "0"}

Bah\nThe Democratic Union of Gambian Activists (DUGA), on Wednesday 3rd January 2018, launched the Gambia chapter of the organization at the Law Faculty in Kanifing, under the theme \u201cWith the masses nothing is impossible; With DUGA we march into the new Gambia with Rekindled Optimism\u201d.\nDUGA is an umbrella movement set up by Gambians in the Diaspora to unite Gambians in North America, Europe and Africa. The mission of the organization is to penetrate the core of Gambian society, sensitize and mobilize citizens to achieve the goal of true and sustainable democracy in the country, through organization, and unity. It could be recalled that the group once occupied the Gambian Embassy in Washington calling for the end to Jammeh\u2019s dictatorship.\nSohna Sallah, Chairperson of DUGA commended Gambians and those in the diaspora for their courage and unity against former president Jammeh. The Gambia she said was able to win tyranny because of the collective sacrifice of the people. Ms. Sallah said DUGA is a civil society movement and not a political party; that they will continue to engage Government while urging them to listen to the concerns of the people who fought for the democratic liberation of the Gambia; that DUGA is committed and will continue to work in enlightening the people of the new Gambia. She called for collaboration saying that their doors are open to all Gambians, at home and abroad.\nRepresenting Ousainou Mbenga, the outgoing Chairman DUGA, was Sophie Ceesay. She said the organisation was formed to advance the issues of women and youth in the struggle for democracy. She commended the Gambian people for their sacrifice in building the new Gambia. DUGA she said will continue to set the ball rolling in advancing democracy and the rule of law in the Gambia.\nThe Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Aboubacarr Tambedou said he was moved when members of DUGA occupied the Gambian Embassy in Washington DC, calling it a big challenge; that the efforts of DUGA contributed in bringing the new Gambia and it must be recognized. The Justice Minister called on Gambians to lay a solid foundation in terms of democracy to get rid of bad governance, torture and rape among other human rights violations. He called for close collaboration with civil society as the Gambia has changed and it has changed for the better. Tambedou called on activists to consolidate activism with responsibility, saying there is no perfect democracy in the world; that activists should not compare the Gambia\u2019s democracy with other advance democracies because it took those nations centuries to get to where they are today.\nIn his solidarity statement Alieu Bah, founding member of Occupy Westfield called on Government to recognize the efforts and roles played by activists and young people. He also advocated for Government to consider the demands and rights of the people who fought to liberate the Gambia from sinking.\nRepresenting Government was the Vice President and Minister of Women Affairs, Adja Fatoumata Jallow Tambajang, who said she recognizes the important roles played by Gambian activists during the historic political impasses in 2016. Government she said is committed and will continue to pursue the rights and welfare of its people; that the present Government inherited a two month budget support. The struggle for the new Gambia she said has enlighten Gambians resulting to inclusiveness; that civil society organizations are the checks and balances of Government.\nPa Samba Jaw delivered the vote of thanks. The launching was well attended by ministers, the Speaker of the National Assembly, renowned Gambian activists and victims of the former regime.", "article_link": "http://foroyaa.gm/duga-rekindles-optimism-in-new-gambia/", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "3"}, "shares": "0"}

We have less than two and half months to that coveted date.\nThe opinion of most people is that either Mr Bio is indecisive or is holding the appointment of his number two man as a bargaining chip for the highest bidder; or that he lacks the ability to determine who can bring the most value to his campaign team.\nIf that is not the case, then Mr Bio and the SLPP are seriously sleeping, and this could cost them many independents or indecisive voters.\nSay what you will, the running mate of any presidential candidate has his or her own constituency. He or she needs time and resources to campaign in their own backyard to pull in the voters.\nNo one candidate will say that he or she alone can contest and win the 55% needed, if he is not supported by someone of similar calibre or wider appeal.\nSo, it will be very risky for Mr Bio to deceive himself that he alone can take the SLPP to victory, without the input of a strong running mate.\nThe voters market in Sierra Leone is the same for all political parties. While the APC and the newly formed NGC have released their full gears with both presidential and running mates, and are now campaigning in all the corners of the country \u2013 especially in the strongholds of the flagbearers and their running mates, the SLPP is still holding meetings searching for a running mate.\nThis should not be a problem for an establish party like the SLPP that claims to have a national appeal and huge membership, especially so close to the elections.\nTwo months is not enough for any running mate to galvanize his or her powerbase to fully support the flagbearer, especially when some of the people he needs would have committed themselves to candidates of other parties that have their structures in place.\nSecondly, the party will need time to pacify those who may be feeling aggrieved, if their preferred candidate is not given the running mate position. The SLPP should think strategically.\nIndecisiveness on the appointment of a is what cost Solomon Berewa in 2007, and Bio in 2012; and its now looking like history is about to repeat itself for the SLPP in 2018.\nThis is serious indecisiveness. And it is the least expected from an ex-military man.", "article_link": "http://www.thesierraleonetelegraph.com/why-is-maada-bio-being-indecisive-about-his-presidential-running-mate/", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "2"}, "shares": "3"}
{"articleId": "1655359627857026", "year": "2018", "month": "01", "day": "05", "publication": "sierraleonetelegraph", "article_text": "John Mannah: Sierra Leone Telegraph: 5 January 2018:\nThe vast majority of Sierra Leoneans have been yearning for change in the last two decades of the country\u2019s history \u2013 most especially, change from economic doom and gloom to prosperity. And it will be an understatement, to say that we have been disappointed by those, whose hands we have entrusted our destiny to bring the change we so desperately desire.\nThis is exactly what Dr. Yumkella has done for those of us who desire and demand that things should change this time around, in the governance structure and political direction of our beloved Sierra Leone.\nDr. Yumkella returned to his beloved Sierra Leone after a stellar international career, and has put everything he has on the line to effect the change we have all been yearning for.\nWe have seen how this gentle academic can handle difficult situations when everything, including the proverbial kitchen sink was thrown at him from the two traditional political parties the SLPP and the APC.\nHe dug deep into his inner core and replied to the disrespectful, tribalist, and elitist charges that were thrown at him, by coming up with what has culminated into the new NGC party, which he now heads as presidential candidate for the forthcoming elections.\nEngineer Keilie by the side of Dr. Kandeh Yumkella, is the best chance Sierra Leoneans have been presented with, since our return to multiparty democracy to change the narrative of our country\u2019s economic story. He brings 40 years of experience to the ticket of the NGC.\nThe question then becomes: what will this academic knowhow and practical experience do for the youth-man and common-man in the streets of Freetown, Bo, Kenema, Makeni, Kabala, Port Loko and Kambia?\nThe answer is that engineer Andrew Keili\u2019s knowledge and experience will inject a paradigm shift into the governance structure of Sierra Leone.\nThis shift is analogous to what Amazon\u2019s CEO Jeff Bezos has done to the book business in the United States and around the world. Engineer Keili is going to help Dr. Yumkellah transcend, supersede and overthrow the existing orthodoxy and manner of running government in Sierra Leone.\nJust as Amazon pioneered the move from selling hard copy books in shops, to selling books online, and successfully so, it is the same way we should join, and help engineer Keili and Dr. Yumkella win the election and govern Sierra Leone, by first hiring the best Sierra Leoneans to work in ministries and government agencies that match their competencies and qualifications.\nAn electrical engineer for example, will be hired with a business background or MBA in Management and Finance to manage the electricity corporation, so will an economist be hired to head an office of economic advisor to the president. These professionals will be well placed to entangle, and synthesize the complex and difficult policy issues the new government will have to deal with and make recommendations to the president who with his vice will make decisions that will be beneficial to our country in both the short-run, and long-run.\nGood economic policies will create the right macroeconomic environment, by reducing inflation to single digit, economic growth to above 6 percent, manage fiscal policy so that government waste and corruption is cut, and create the economic space for the private sector to invest and create jobs for our youths.\nHe will point to himself, Dr. Yumkellah, Dr. Dennis Bright, Dr. Spencer, Ms. Jusu Sheriff, etc., as examples of people who acquired good education and have used it to do well in life with honor and integrity.\nTo the youths, women and common people of Sierra Leone, don\u2019t let anybody fool you that the NGC is elitist because they have educated people in their leadership.\nYes, they have educated people, and these educated people are what our country needs at this time in the country\u2019s history to engage, analyze and synthesize the complex, and dynamic global issues in the marketplace and bring in the necessary policies that will help put our natural resources to better use for the long-run betterment of our country.\nWe have tried common sense, with Ernest Koroma and his APC simplicity. It has not worked, because the world is a complex place, and thus, we need leaders who understand the complexities of global issues to make decisions that will help market our country for the betterment of all.\nThe combined experience of Dr. Yumkella and Engineer Andrew Keili, and the rest of the NGC leadership, will do the job for Sierra Leone this time around. Let\u2019s seize the opportunity that has been presented to us, folks as it will never come again.", "article_link": "http://www.thesierraleonetelegraph.com/kandeh-yumkella-andrew-keili-poised-to-win-2018-elections/", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "2"}, "shares": "3"}

Source: Ryan Morse, CC BY-SA\n[/tie_full_img]\nMartin Schneider often got things done faster than a female colleague, Nicole Hallberg, who worked at the same small employment services agency. He figured this was because of his extra experience.\nOne day, however, a client suddenly began acting \u201cimpossible,\u201d \u201crude\u201d and \u201cdismissive,\u201d as Schneider recalled in a series of tweets.\nHe soon realized why. Schneider had inadvertently used Hallberg\u2019s email signature in his messages to the client. (They used a shared inbox.) When he told the client he was actually Martin and not Nicole, there was \u201cimmediate improvement\u201d in the exchange.\nIntrigued, Schneider and Hallberg agreed to do an experiment in which they switched email signatures for two weeks. What happened? Hallberg had the \u201cmost productive week of her career.\u201d Meanwhile, Schneider was in \u201chell\u201d as clients condescended and questioned everything he suggested.\nSumming up the lesson, Schneider tweeted: \u201cI wasn\u2019t any better at the job than she was, I just had this invisible advantage.\u201d\nSexism in the workplace\nIn many ways, the result of their experiment should not come as a surprise.\nSexism in the workplace is well documented in surveys and in academic literature. Recent reports of overt harassment in the private and public sectors confirm that it is alive and well. Further, the data show persistent gender gaps in pay, hiring and promotions across occupations and skill levels.\nMy own research looks at how the burgeoning gig economy \u2013 in which jobs are short-term or freelance rather than permanent \u2013 affects gender and other forms of labour discrimination. A study we recently conducted with colleagues at the Centre for Distributive, Labour and Social Studies in Argentina suggests an increasingly freelance workforce may make the problem of male privilege even worse.\nMaria and Jos\u00e9\nDiscrimination in the labour market is notoriously difficult to study.\nFor decades, social scientists have tried to disentangle differences in ability, career preferences, attitudes towards risk and negotiation and other worker characteristics from true discrimination by employers. However, as economic transactions increasingly migrate to peer-to-peer platforms, this perspective misses an important piece of the discrimination puzzle: that of the interactions between gender of the employer and gender of the job seeker.\nFor example: Do gender stereotypes also put women at a disadvantage when they\u2019re the ones doing the hiring? Are women less likely to negotiate salaries and promotions with a male employer?\nTo answer these questions, we designed the following experiment: We randomly selected and invited 2,800 freelancers on Nubelo, a large online platform for short-term job contracts based in Spain that\u2019s now part of Freelancer.com, to apply for a job to transcribe and edit an hour long marketing video.\nEach invitation came from the same employer, a fictitious marketing services agency. Half of the freelancers (randomly selected) received the email from \u201cMaria,\u201d while the rest learned about the job opportunity from \u201cJos\u00e9.\u201d In addition, half of the invitations asked freelancers to name their price for the job, while the other half offered a flat pay of \u20ac250 (US$301).\nMale privilege at work\nThe results confirmed our intuition: Male privilege not only hurts women when they\u2019re looking for work, it also puts them at a disadvantage when they\u2019re the ones doing the hiring.\nIn our study, Jos\u00e9 was able to solicit significantly lower rates from prospective job candidates than Maria, even though the work was identical. Candidates offered to do the job for an average of \u20ac124 when Jos\u00e9 sent the invitation, while they demanded \u20ac158 from Maria (or about 27 percent more for the same exact job).\nWhen we control for differences in the characteristics of the job seekers, such as experience and reputation on the site, the female employer penalty remains essentially unchanged. More interestingly, this result obtained for both male and female job seekers.\nWere women less willing to negotiate with Jos\u00e9 or Maria? Not in our study. In fact we found no statistically significant differences in negotiation preferences across our four employer-freelancer combinations. Female freelancers were just as likely as men to respond to our email when it invited them to name their price, and it made no difference whether the email came from Maria or Jos\u00e9.\nIn other words, as long as the rules of the game are clearly laid out (that freelancers should name their price), female job applicants were willing to bargain as much as male applicants, and the gender of the other party (the employer) did not seem to affect this result.\nRise of the gig economy\nAn increasing number of people make a living in the gig economy. In a 2016 poll, 24 percent of Americans reported earning money from gig economy platforms, and the majority said that this income is important or essential to make ends meet. In this context, what are the implications of our findings?\nSome claim the rise of \u201calternative work\u201d arrangements could offer opportunities for women to close the remaining labour market gaps. Our results suggest a more uncertain future. On the one hand, they indicate that women may gain from workplace environments in which the rules of bargaining are unambiguous, as studies show that men often have the upper hand when the rules are less clear.\nOn the other, our results suggest that the gig economy could potentially exacerbate gender discrimination. In the hypercompetitive, fast-paced world of online labour, hiring and wages are determined on the basis of little verifiable information about each individual worker. These conditions favour the activation of stereotypes about \u201cappropriate\u201d jobs for women, their productivity and their willingness to bargain. Further, as traditional worker-employer relations are replaced by peer-to-peer transactions on a global scale, the application of anti-discrimination labour law becomes challenging.\nAs we look at the impact of technology on the future of work, there are some reasons for optimism but plenty for concern. The truth is, while technology extends our capabilities as human beings, it can not, unfortunately, eliminate our biases and prejudices.\n\u00a9 2018, The Chronicle of Education.

The 37-year-old businesswoman and socialite talked about love, parenting and yes, Hamisa Mobeto\u2019s affair with Diamond Platinumz. The Observer transcribed parts of the lengthy interview:\nThe beautiful Zari\u2026Welcome!\nThank you!\nYou always look so stunning, but what was little Zari like?\nI have always been this person. I haven\u2019t changed\u2026 I come from a family of six girls and two brothers.\nAnd what were your parents like?\nMy mum passed on. It is about four months. That was just seven weeks after Ivan [Ssemwanga, her ex-husband and father of her three older sons] died. My mum raised us when our dad left. She was that person you could run to whatever the problem was.\nLosing a parent is\u2026\n\u2026is so hard!\nHave you thought about counselling?\nI haven\u2019t really been for counselling. I did take the kids for counselling when their dad passed on. I have learnt to pick myself up from my falls.\nYou were born in Jinja\u2026?\nYes. Then we moved to Kampala. Jinja used to be the \u2018it\u2019 town. We moved here in 1997, then I moved to the UK, then to South Africa.\nWhich schools did you go to?\nI went to Main Street primary school, Muljibhai Madhvani girls school. I did cosmetology in the UK and mastered my HR skills in South Africa.\nWere you that child who wore mummy\u2019s dresses?\nI was a makeup type of girl. I used to have a lot of dolls and play mummy\u2026 and it is what I have turned out to be. I am so mummy. I love being mummy more than anything else.\nHow did you decide to do cosmetology?\nI love beauty. My aunt used to be an air hostess\u2026 everything about her used to make me think, wow, this woman! She inspired me. Rest her soul in peace.\n[Crystal plays Zari\u2019s request, Despacito by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee.]\nDid you ever work in the UK?\nI did, but I know what I want in my life and the work in the UK was not what I wanted for my life. I worked at a QuickSave, at a Sainsbury, then a sandwich factory\u2026then I said hold on, this isn\u2019t my life. I\u2019m going back to Africa. [Zari was in the UK for two years and tells Crystal she eventually got a residence permit. She has lived in South Africa for 17 years.]\nHow do you do the balancing game between South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda?\nI travel a lot, but you also need to prioritise. Number one is time management.\nSo, South Africa\u2026\nI worked in South Africa about two years, then I met Ivan. He was doing his own thing. I told Ivan, you have your thing going, but it\u2019s a bit shady. Now we are going to start a family and I don\u2019t think I want to be on the run all the time.\nI gave him the example of a Ugandan guy who owned a primary school. He drove the latest cars\u2026 I wanted that life. He was like, \u2018no, I\u2019m not so educated to go there\u2019\u2026 I said, we do not need to be educated to do this.\nWe need to know how the system works. I started doing my research and contacting people, going to the department of education\u2026 I told him, we don\u2019t need to be the principals of our schools, we just need to hire people we can pay.\nWe put in our applications. It was rough in the beginning\u2026 Eventually we started with one floor, two floors. Now we own branches nationwide in South Africa. It has been one rollercoaster, but I am proud I pushed for it\u2026being CEO of these companies. I\u2019m still here and it was worth it.\nWell done! Back in Uganda you were like, boom! Who are this couple?\nWhat made our life so big in Uganda is we were the flashy couple.\nWere you flashy in SA as well?\nI don\u2019t know. For me these things have become a lifestyle. I don\u2019t even know when it is flashy [or not]. When I pop champagne in my home, I\u2019ll probably post it on Instagram or Twitter. It\u2019s just my lifestyle!\nI don\u2019t like being called a socialite. I am a mum, a businesswoman. There is a difference between me and slay queens, slay cartoons\u2026 They pop champagne for social media while living under waragi circumstances. [She requests for Dance, by Timaya.]\nHave you always been like this? Tell it as it is?\nYeah. It is what it is. You take it or leave it.\nYou and Ivan were together a long time\u2026\nAlmost 11 years.\nWhat made you decide finally, that I\u2019m done?\nIvan wasn\u2019t really a bad guy. He was just really obsessed with me. When an obsession grows, it becomes a bad thing. It got to a point where it became really nasty-physical. I really tried to work on it\u2026 We had his family and my family coming together a couple of times and we would leave this week and fly back to SA and bang, we were back to square one.\nYou don\u2019t stay with someone this long, build an empire, have children\u2026 and just walk away. People say she is a prostitute, malaaya, biki\u2026 They are very quick to judge. I was the one keeping this relationship together. I stayed in a very abusive relationship. He would say, you want to leave me? You will have to go through the balcony\u2026 people don\u2019t get it.\nBut with time comes healing and forgiving. When he passed on, we were really good friends. I would joke about the girls he was dating, he would joke about Diamond\u2026\nThen you had that drama when a very intimate video of you surfaced.\nPeople like making drama\u2026 \u2018oh, she has a sex video\u2019\u2026 I am not ashamed of my past. I was dating someone when I left Ivan. Because of the long distance we would get on the phone and do whatever we had to do. We were adults.\nI think this person had recorded a session. When I wanted to leave him\u2026it was just a rebound thing\u2026this person blackmailed me. He wanted me to pay him. I told him go ahead. Now it is out. It\u2019s done.\nThen you met Diamond. What do you call him at home?\nDee, or Baba T. He calls me Zee or Mama T [their daughter is called Tiffah].\nYou have been so open to love [despite the heartbreaks]\u2026\n\u2026I\u2019m such a girly-girl. I want to be loved. It is so beautiful for someone to call you at the end of the day\u2026 Even if I left Diamond today, I would still fall in love probably 20,000 times.\nSpeaking of Diamond, was it hard to date him?\nWhen two famous people date, people will always scrutinise. But when we get home, I am not Zari the boss lady. He is not Diamond Platinumz. We don\u2019t bring [that world] into our home.\nAt home, he is my man, I\u2019m his woman. He\u2019s such a humble guy. He cooks, he is good with the kids, plans all our vacations. [She clarifies she has never moved to Tanzania.]\nHow do you feel about him cheating on you?\nCheating and having a baby with another person. It was betrayal at its best. I could not talk about these things, but because I have made peace with them, I can talk about them and not feel anything. People cheat, but why are you cheating in our bed?\nWhy are you cheating with some low-life things out there? Why are you not wearing a condom when you know you have kids involved and you could catch HIV? I had like 20 million questions\u2026 The baby is innocent. I will not refuse him to see his child. We\u2019ve had a discussion\u2026but you never know with musicians\u2026there will always be groupies; you never know when the next scandal is going to hit you.\nSo, who is Zari?\nI love being mummy. The \u2018Mumpreneur\u2019. I\u2019m a businesswoman, I\u2019m very humble and I like having fun.\nDo you feel you\u2019re on the right track?\nNo! I\u2019m not on the right track until I fly private jets. I\u2019m still in business class until I sit in a private jet, then I\u2019m like, \u2018yeah!

{"articleId": "1646680868687669", "year": "2018", "month": "01", "day": "06", "publication": "TheEastAfrican", "article_text": "Best known for his paintings of plump characters curled up on the canvas in various shades of caramel, cream, biscuit and beige, Sebastian Kiarie is among the younger members of Kenya\u2019s First Generation artists \u2014 those who found a home at the now defunct Watatu gallery, and whose work was targeted primarily at moneyed tourists and NGO staffers on short term contracts.\nThey wanted something to take home that reminded them of their sojourn in this colourful continent.\nAnd self-taught Kiarie, based in the artist\u2019s village of Ngecha, a few kilometres outside Nairobi, was there to oblige with warm memories of men young and old sleepy with chang'aa, of lovers gazing at each other with heavy lidded eyes, of dutiful priests presiding over weddings, of market mamas and, generally, of a gentle stroll around the backwaters of local life.\nIn short, happy stories to hang on the wall that, like snapshots in the family album, were souvenirs of a lovely time that said, \u201cWish you were still here.\u201d\nSoft, gentle, inoffensive and really rather sweet, they were the signature works of an artist who clearly loved life, had a wry sense of humour and who created a parallel altogether safer world where poverty seemed bearable and a happy chaos was controlled.\nBut not any more.\nFor at the age of 46 \u2014 a man in his prime \u2014 Kiarie has found his teeth.\nA raft of what he calls \u201csocial, political and cultural realities\u201d are all under attack in his current exhibition, while the artist also illuminates our refusal to take responsibility for our actions and how we become prisoners of our own past.\nOf the 29 paintings on show at the Banana Hill Art Gallery (until January 12) more than half represent a furious and barely controlled attack both on his primary targets including electoral fraud, financial greed and state oppression, and, by implication, on his own artistic past.\nThese are large paintings too; at 196cm by 161cm they are very much in your face.\nA few examples: The destructive effects of electoral fraud are realised in Addicted, which shows a man, trousers round his ankles, seated and masturbating against a ballot box; a rather obvious image all the more surprising coming from a painter whose social comment has usually been firmly on the comfortable side of the line.\nFinancial greed and hypocrisy are condemned in Pig Eaters, in which three men in top hats prepare to devour a pig\u2019s head, placed on a plate before them. The men are gangsters, we are told, attempting to look holy in their spotless white suits and the pig\u2019s head will be eaten raw and with the hands. It is, the artist says, more delicious that way.\nThis painting, Kiarie tells us, is of humanity demeaned by a drive for self-preservation, and it references people rewarded with high positions in society thanks to taxpayers\u2019 money. The pig\u2019s head, I assume, represents the people on whom high-placed people feast.\nThese paintings are part of a series Kiarie calls Not My Fault in which he examines how our identities affect our relationships and how people refuse to take responsibility for their actions, and instead \u201cblame their predicaments on circumstances as well as on other people.\u201d\nThe Saint shows a man surrounded by religious symbols, which represent his imagined goodness yet are also symbols of his past life from which he unable to free himself.\nAgain, authority\u2019s indifference to the plight of wananchi, whom it is supposed to serve, is shown in a painting of a shackled prisoner screaming while his jailer, a policeman, stands impassively by.\nThese new paintings reflect their uncompromising subject matter through a more strident palette, slashing brushwork and in many cases, a deliberate rawness that leaves viewers used to Kiarie\u2019s more traditional works wide-eyed with surprise.\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the Expressionists, think of the Belgian James Ensor and the violence of his parade and circus paintings. The other half of Kiarie\u2019s show contains works on a similar theme of protest \u2014 the whole amounts to a howl against the society the artist believes we have become \u2014 yet, with their colouring and dozy, smiling faces painted with more precision and even love, are more familiar to those who know this artist well.\nThe backgrounds of these smaller works are left unfinished, throwing the focus onto the faces, on the people, leaving the surroundings less important than was usual.\nOddly enough all these faces, male and female, seem to be of the same person. They too then are symbols \u2014 perhaps quotations from the artist\u2019s own past works and a history from which he too is unable to free himself.\n\u201cMy artwork,\u201d states Kiarie, \u201cis an invitation to the viewer to unmask and consider the possibility of an exchange between my perspectives and their own.\u201d\nI admire Kiarie for being open to argument \u2014 and for the fact that he decided not to apply the same qualitative care to these new paintings that he did to his previous work, presumably in the belief that their rowdy energy will add to the force of his proposition.\nBut abandoning the commercial niceties is likely to come at a cost.\nIt will take a strong willed collector to accept this artist\u2019s break with his cosy convention enough to want one on the wall.", "article_link": "https://bit.ly/2CMU2yV", "comments": "0", "reactions": {"likes": "3"}, "shares": "0"}

He was given the task in July 2016 and he has since then worked with a group of experts to identify key areas of reform.\nWhile addressing the 2nd Africa Business Forum in Sham el Sheikh last month, President Kagame said the reforms were well on course.\n\u201cThe institutional reform of the African Union that is currently underway, with strong support from African leaders, is essential to getting these agreements fully operational so that our citizens can enjoy the benefits,\u201d he said in reference to deals signed to grow the private sector and doing business on the continent.\nHe added that African countries need to make it easier to do business within and amongst themselves.\n\u201cOur continent has to catch up fast and compete globally. We can\u2019t afford to waste opportunities because of unnecessary red tape and the associated delays. We should make it easier to do business with each other in Africa and integrate our markets to make them more attractive for investment,\u201d he said.\nHowever, regional blocs on the continent are currently going through integration challenges.\n\u201cThere are issues within the EAC. Countries are not at par. There are issues between Uganda and Rwanda, Burundi and Rwanda, Tanzania and Kenya. The same can be said of SADC, which right now is not united due to political challenges,\u201d a scholar at the University of Rwanda said.\nCommitment\nIn a recent interview with on Rwanda Television, Rwanda\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs Louise Mushikiwabo said reforms within the AU are progressing well with more than 20 countries already implementing national policies to raise revenue to go towards the AU.\nUnder the new self-financing mechanism, member states are obliged to levy a 0.2 per cent tax on eligible imports. If all member states committed to this, at least $1.2bn would be raised annually, enough to finance the AU\u2019s activities.\nMs Mushikiwabo said that while this move is aimed at making the AU self-sustaining, it does not mean that the continental body will cut ties with donors.\n\u201cWe will continue to work with the different partners we have been working with including the EU, the US China, Japan and others, but we are saying that it is important for Africa to foot the bill for AU activities. This is a key element of the reforms,\u201d she said.\nPresident Kagame wrote to African leaders last month giving them an update on the progress of the reforms.\nThere have been concerns, however, that some countries are dragging their feet in implementing the financing agreement.\nPresident Kagame will also reportedly be pushing for an open border policy to effect the African Passport, which was launched in 2016.", "article_link": "http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/Kagame-African-Union-chairman-reforms/2558-4253016-vci5rt/index.html", "comments": "3", "reactions": {"likes": "52"}, "shares": "17"}

Addis Ababa is a very successful hub. Out of the around 11 million passengers we transport every year, 70 per cent are not entering Addis. They are transit passengers to other African countries and the rest of the world.\n\"We are connecting Europe with Africa, the Middle East with Africa and Asia with Africa. We want to expand this and be close to the customers. With a very large landmass and around one billion population, Africa has a high growth opportunity.
