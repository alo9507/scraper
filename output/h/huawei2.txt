As a corporate company, MTN believes that businesses can only thrive when the communities within which they work are equally thriving, thus the need for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to improve lives in the communities. WIM VANHELLEPUTTE the chief executive officer MTN Uganda tells us why MTN Uganda is seriously involved in CSR. Please tell us about MTN’s rationale for taking part in CSR At MTN we have a vision to provide a modern connected digital life to every customer. However, we understand that as a business, MTN can only flourish when the communities and ecosystems in which it operates are healthy. In all we do, we strive to leverage our core capabilities to enable the socio-economic development of the communities within which we operate. I think as CSR as a win-win. It is a big win for the company and even a bigger win for the community. How does MTN execute its CSR? CSR is fully embedded in our overall strategy. Every year we donate a certain percentage of our profits through the MTN Foundation. The money is dedicated to improving the lives of people in the communities in the most pressing areas of education, health and national priority areas such as youth empowerment among others. We endeavour to maintain an emphasis on addressing National priority areas aligned with the National Development Plan of each of our markets. This is why we have strong working partnerships with the health and education sectors, and it is also the reason why we are always quick to come in when there are natural disasters like it was with COVID-19, floods in different parts of the country. It is also a known fact that all the money from the MTN Kampala Marathon goes towards charity. Please tell us more about it. The idea of the MTN marathon has really been about mobilising the population and other corporate bodies to rally together behind specific causes that require urgent attention in our communities. It has helped us draw attention to very important issues in the community such as maternal health, basic needs like water in some parts of the country. We take pride in our association with partners like Stanbic bank, New Vision, Huawei and Rwenzori among others who donate selflessly towards the Marathon and to all the participants who take part in the Marathon to make a difference in people’s lives. We believe that our vision to build sustainable societies can be achieved through partnerships and collaboration, helping in the realisation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Why is MTN passionate about giving back to the communities? As explained in the beginning, MTN Uganda can only flourish when the communities and ecosystems in which it operates are healthy. In all we do, we strive to leverage our core capabilities to enable the socio-economic development of the communities within which we operate. The MTN Marathon is just one tool through which we make our contribution. We also have a foundation whose focus is to carry out our CSI agenda and through it we have been able to do a lot in the community. Since it is part of MTN’s vision, we expect to see more MTN Initiatives in the community. Briefly tell us about the future of MTN CSR Definitely just like we have a business plan, we have a solid plan for our CSR. As the communities we work with advance, their needs also evolve. Our CSI program currently focuses on National Priority Areas (Education, Health, women empowerment, disaster relief) and Employee volunteerism and more recently we are adding youth empowerment to the agenda. This will focus on empowering them with the relevant skills required in the current times so as to systematically address job creation, enhance competitiveness and drive inclusive growth. Why particularly the youth? Youth account for over 60% of the population across our markets. If we can address the issue of job creation in youths and enable them to be contributors to the growth of their country, this will drive inclusive growth as well as positively impact communities standards of living. This strategic move is to really unlock the potential of youths in building the economy. What are your final remarks to the public regarding giving back to the community? First of all let me thank everybody out there, whether individual or organisation that is involved in giving back and supporting communities. Development in any form is not a preserve of the government. It is a collective effort that everybody should get involved in their own little way. As MTN we strongly believe that we are good together because, that way we can achieve a lot more.

According to the whistle-blower, government might get a raw deal from the $75 million (Shs 270 billion) Regional Communications Infrastructure Program (RCIP), since the project is most likely going to be awarded to the highest bidder. The RCIP project is being implemented by National Information Technology Authority - Uganda (NITA-U), and is intended to improve government’s efficiency and transparency through e-government applications as well as lower internet connectivity prices and extend the geographic reach of broadband networks. The procurement was initiated on August 3, 2017 after NITA-U ran an advert in the New Vision inviting bids to implement the project. The bid attracted six companies: Wanainchi Telecom, ZTE, Camsat, Banwidth & Crown services + Wuhang Fibre Home, Raubex Infra (Pty) and Huawei. While Huawei submitted the highest bid price of $15.8 million (about Shs 57.7 billion), it has since emerged as the favoured company for the project. According to the whistle-blower, Hauwei had been shortlisted along with another Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE, whose bid price was $8.6m (Shs 31.3 billion). The whistle-blower says by the close of business on January 15, 2018, ZTE had been dropped. Under normal bidding processes, the source said, Huawei would have been dropped by virtue of being the highest bidder. The lowest bidder was Camsat, pricing their bid at $8.2m (Shs 29.9 billion). Interviewed, the chairman of the evaluation committee, Paul Ngabirano, declined to say much since the process is still ongoing. “The process is still on, and, under the procurement regulations, I am not supposed to comment until it is concluded,” Ngabirano said. ANXIETY NITA-U executive director James Saaka, instead, blamed over-anxious bidders some of whom, he said, had leaked documents on the project to Budadiri West MP Nathan Nandala-Mafabi. “I know there is a letter that has been written to Mafabi but the procurement process is not yet complete because even I, the accounting officer, haven’t seen the evaluation report yet,” Saaka said. “Prospective bidders sometimes get over anxious but they should wait for the process to be concluded,” he added. The latest revelations come against a backdrop of fraudulent scandals that have rocked the body charged with regulating the ICT sector. According to the source, NITA-U bosses entered into multimillion dollar contracts with companies linked to some of the bosses at the IT regulatory agency. Among such deals, is the contract to certify ICT companies that want to do business with government which was awarded to Comtel Africa. Comtel Africa, owned by a former NITA-U board member, was allowed to take 80 per cent of the revenue it collects and only remit 20 per cent to NITA-U. While the whistle-blower cites some influence peddling in the deal, Saaka said that the former board member got the contract on merit. “It was an international competitive bidding process where no one can be accused of influence peddling, being a former board member doesn’t stop anyone from doing business, and secondly, he is in partnership with another company,” Saaka said. NITA-U is also said to have conspicuously entered into another contract with SYBYL (Computer Point) to a build a data centre at $13m (Shs 45.5 billion) NITA-U bosses are also accused of causing the government a monthly loss of more than Shs 30bn paid to Kenyan IT giants Soliton Telmec to offer internet services to government departments and ministries through the national backbone infrastructure. The whistle-blower claims the $300 (Shs 1.08 million) that the ministries pay per mbps (megabits per second - data transfer speed) is too high compared to what is paid in neighbouring countries like Rwanda where government pays $50 (Shs 180,000) per mbps. Government is also reported to be cheated in the procurement of Cisco switches, which NITA-U buys at $2,600 (Shs 9.3 million) as opposed to Shs 1.4 million on the open market. It also pays $1,200 (Shs 4.3 million) for manhole covers that the same supplier sells to MTN at Shs 400,000. Saaka, however, says that the costs were previously high because of fewer users. For instance, he said, in 2011, when the national backbone infrastructure was implemented, government used to pay $1,200 (Shs 4.3 million) per mbps which has drastically fallen to current figure of $70 (Shs 252,000) with 280 government ministries and departments connected in addition to 186 free public Wi-Fi hotspots. sadabkk@observer.ug

IN the article, “The great transformer: The impact of the Internet on economic growth and prosperity” (2011) James Manyika and Charles Roxburgh seek to explain the influence of Information Communication Technology in economic development. They argue that the internet is changing the way we work, socialise, create and share information, and organise the flow of people, ideas, and things around the globe. “Yet the magnitude of this transformation is still under-appreciated. The Internet accounted for 21 percent of the GDP growth in mature economies over the past five years. “In that time, we went from a few thousand students accessing Facebook to more than 800 million users around the world, including many leading firms, who regularly update their pages and share content. While large enterprises and national economies have reaped major benefits from this technological revolution, individual consumers and small, upstart entrepreneurs have been some of the greatest beneficiaries from the Internet’s empowering influence. “As a result, governments, policy makers, and businesses must recognise and embrace the enormous opportunities the internet can create, even as they work to address the risks to security and privacy the internet brings. “As the internet’s evolution over the past two decades has demonstrated, such work must include helping to nurture the development of a healthy internet ecosystem, one that boosts infrastructure and access, builds a competitive environment that benefits users and lets innovators and entrepreneurs thrive, and nurtures human capital. Together these elements can maximise the continued impact of the internet on economic growth and prosperity.” It has been proven that the internet is a major driver for economic growth as it has become a day-to-day reality for more than a quarter of the world’s people. More than two billion people are connected to the internet, and almost US$8 trillion exchange hands each year through e-commerce. It is behind that background that the commissioning of the US$23,6 million National Backbone Fibre Link in Beitbridge by President Mnangagwa last week was a major milestone. The project is set to boost the country’s Information Communication Technology capacity and status as a regional communications hub. The link connects Beitbridge with Bulawayo, Harare, Masvingo and the rest of the country using underground cables. It will also reduce TelOne operating costs by 40 percent and the benefit is expected to cascade to consumers. Funded by the China Export and Import Bank, the fibre link was constructed by TelOne and Chinese company Huawei Technologies. President Mnangagwa reiterated that the initiative will turn Zimbabwe into a land-linked country, shaking off the landlocked tag. “This project is undoubtedly set to have a far-reaching impact towards the attainment of our national vision as it relates to ICT where we envisage having Internet access at village level by 2030. It will enhance our country’s land-linked status as it efficiently connects us with the rest of the world. By embracing technology and connectivity, we are embracing the future, and giving our people the best opportunities to thrive in the modern economy,” said President Mnangagwa. “We note with pride that the establishment of these fibre links has completed the connectivity of Zimbabwe with our neighbouring countries, specifically South Africa, Mozambique, Botswana and Zambia. The link will also provide transit services that enable Sadc members connecting to the whole world through a robust fibre network.” More Stories:

Peter Matika, Senior Reporter A MAN from Entumbane suburb in Bulawayo has appeared in court for allegedly robbing a man of two cellphones, before going on to stealing more than $1 000 from his Ecocash wallet. Itai Muzambi (23) initially appeared in court 16 August this year, facing charges of theft. According to the State’s case Muzambi, stole the two cellphones an Alcatel and Huawei belonging to Mr Thandumuzi Dabengwa at Club 263 in Bulawayo. The court heard that after he stole the phones, he carried out Ecocash transactions, where he transferred various amounts of money to different numbers totaling $1 873. Mr Dabengwa then approached Econet where a statement confirmed that money had been withdrawn from his wallet. He reported the matter to the police, who in turn apprehended Muzambi on 16 August. The accused is being represented by Mr Mlweliwenkululeko Ncube of Ncube and Partners Legal Practitioners. Miss Nomasiko Ndlovu presided over the case, while Mr Charles Danda presented the case for the state. Muzambi is scheduled to appear in court for continuation of trial tomorrow. @peterkmatika
