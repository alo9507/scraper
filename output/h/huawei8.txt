Thousands of homes, offices and enterprises can now get connected to the fastest and most reliable internet highway as The Gambia yesterday signed the national ICT strategic agreement with Chinese global tech giant Huawei at a twinned event which also included the formal launching of the national broadband network project, NBP. The ceremony was presided over by vice president Dr Isatou Touray and attended by the Chinese Ambassador to the Gambia and the West African regional director of Huawei. The vice president, who represented President Barrow expressed deep gratitude to the Chinese government and president Xi Jinping for their support to the Gambia. She said China has been committed to supporting the New Gambia in many respects and the national broadband is one of the most important cooperation projects. “The project not only extends the country’s 400 km optical fiber but also plays an important role in the national development plan. It has succeeded in making the last mile of the original national optical network so that households and enterprises can easily access the internet at a lower price and enjoy digital services,” she said. Mr Seedy Jaiteh, MD of Gamtel expressed appreciation to the guests and introduced the NBP as the first concessional loan project between The Gambia and China at the tune of 26 million dollars. The project will be delivered by the Gamtel and Huawei team within 18 months closely watched by both presidents Barrow and Xi Jinping. “Gamtel will now launch the G- Fiber series products base on the project to provide gigabit fiber services for home (FTTH) and enterprises, the FTTB. This indicates that Gambia entered the digital era”, MD Jaiteh said. The Huawei CEO for West Africa said what started as a fruitful discussion two years ago has now materialised into The Gambia national broadband network project, a national information highway. “This project not only connects schools, homes, banks and industries but also creates more employment,” he said. Other speakers included Ebrima Sillah, the minister of information and communications infrastructure who thanked the joint implementation team for a job well executed and on budget.

London, United Kingdom | AFP | Britain said Friday it was pushing the United States to form a club of 10 nations that could develop its own 5G technology and reduce dependence on China’s controversial technology giant Huawei. The issue is expected to feature at a G7 summit that US President Donald Trump will host next month against the backdrop of a fierce confrontation with China that has been exacerbated by a global blame game over the spread of the novel coronavirus. Britain has allowed the Chinese global leader in 5G technology to build up to 35 percent of the infrastructure necessary to roll out its new speedy data network. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson was reported by The Telegraph newspaper last week to have instructed officials to draw up plans to cut Huawei out of the network by 2023 as relations with China sour. The Times newspaper said Britain is proposing a “D10” club of democratic partners that groups the G7 nations with Australia and the Asian technology leaders South Korea and India. It said one of the options involves channelling investments into existing telecommunication companies within the 10 member states. A Downing Street spokesman confirmed that Britain is reaching out to partners in search for an alternative to Huawei. “We (are) seeking new entrants into the market in order to diversify and that is something we’ve been speaking with our allies about, including the United States,” the Downing Street spokesman said. – Few options – Finland’s Nokia and Sweden’s Ericsson are Europe’s only current alternative options for supplying 5G equipment such as antennas and relay masts. “We need new entrants to the market,” a UK government source told The Times. “That was the reason we ended up having to go along with Huawei at the time.” Johnson’s decision to include Huawei angered Washington because it believes that the private Chinese company can either spy on Western communications or simply shut down the UK network under orders from Beijing. The United States has imposed several rounds of sanctions on Huawei that have put the future of Britain’s 5G rollout in peril. Downing Street said the UK National Cyber Security Centre was studying the implication of the US sanctions on Huawei’s immediate ability to produce the equipment Britain needs. Pressure on Johnson to cut ties with Huawei is being compounded by the new security law Beijing plans to impose on the once British-held Hong Kong. London infuriated Beijing on Thursday by saying it would offer 350,000 Hong Kong nationals holding a British National (Oversees) passport the right to relocate to the UK if the new law goes into effect. But Johnson’s reported plan to completely remove Huawei from the UK network could prove costly at a time when his government is seeking new trade partners following Britain’s exit from the EU. Johnson challenged his US critics in January to come up with an alternative to Huawei if they did not want Britain to use the Chinese firm.

Dongguan, China | AFP | Chinese telecom giant Huawei unveiled its own operating system on Friday, as it faces the threat of losing access to Android systems amid escalating US-China trade tensions. The highly-anticipated software is considered crucial for the tech group’s survival as it confronts a looming White House ban on US companies selling technology products to Huawei which could remove its access to Google’s Android operating system. Richard Yu, the head of Huawei’s consumer business, revealed HarmonyOS or HongMeng in Chinese at a press conference in the southern city of Dongguan. He said the first version would launch later this year in its smart screen products, before expanding across a range of smart devices including wearable technology over the next three years. “If you’re asking when will we apply this to the smartphone, we can do it at any time,” said Yu, adding that they gave priority to using Google’s Android operating system. “However, if we cannot use it (Android) in the future, we can immediately switch to the Harmony OS,” he said. Yu said HarmonyOS was “future oriented” and designed to be “more smooth and secure”, which he said was “completely different” from Android and Apple operating systems. The company has been swept into the deepening trade war between Beijing and Washington which has seen punitive tariffs slapped on billions of dollars of two-way trade. Huawei — considered the world leader in superfast fifth-generation or 5G equipment and the world’s number two smartphone producer — has been blacklisted by US President Donald Trump amid suspicions it provides a backdoor for Chinese intelligence services, something the firm denies. As a result, American companies are theoretically no longer allowed to sell technology products to the firm, but a three-month exemption period — which ends next week — was granted by Washington before the measure came into force. That ban could prevent the Chinese tech firm from getting hold of key hardware and software including smartphone chips and elements of the Google Android operating system, which equips the vast majority of smartphones in the world, including those of Huawei. On Thursday Beijing slammed the US for releasing new rules banning Huawei and other Chinese companies from government contracts, saying they amounted to an “abuse of state power”. – ‘Plan B’ – Huawei has reportedly been working on its own operating system since 2012, but the group has always said publicly it did not want to replace its Android phones with a home operating system. Yu told German newspaper Die Welt in an interview published in March that it was “Plan B”. Huawei will be able to “develop at a lower cost a brand new ecosystem” and “mitigate its dependence on US suppliers for its software needs”, Kenny Liew, technology analyst at Fitch Solutions, told AFP. However, smartphones using the system would mainly be confined to the Chinese market, Liew said. Specialist tech media sites suggested there would be some major hurdles to overcome with Huawei expecting developers to recompile their apps for the new operating system. “It’s unclear exactly how easy that will be for developers,” said an initial review on Vox media’s tech news website, The Verge. “There are a lot of big promises here, but it’s going to be an even bigger challenge to build up an app ecosystem to rival both Android and Android Open Source Project,” it said. Developing an operating system and the entire ecosystem that accompanies it is a complex affair. Apart from Google’s Android, the only other popular operating system is Apple’s iOS, available exclusively on the iPhone. Microsoft pulled the plug on its Windows Phone platform earlier this year, and Samsung’s Tizen system is barely known compared with Android and iOS. But without access to the full version of Android or the popular services of Google — not to mention the many applications available on the Google Play store — Huawei may have trouble convincing consumers outside China to buy its phones.

Paris, France | AFP | Smartphones are a product with which China has demonstrated not only its manufacturing prowess, but its ambitions to become a cutting-edge technology developer thanks to the rise of Huawei. The company is not just in the lead in developing equipment for fifth-generation networks, it has also moved into the high-end smartphone segment. But the US clampdown on the firm over fears Huawei’s products could be used for Chinese spying demonstrates just how global the manufacturing of smartphones remains. Take for example , its latest top-of-the-line smartphone, as the company’s overseas sales have plummeted by 40 percent as the firm grapples with the ban on using US technology. – Screen – The P30 uses an AMOLED screen, a technology that was principally developed by the US firm Kodak. The two largest manufacturers of such screens are South Korea’s Samsung and LG. Huawei buys the screens for the P30 from Samsung. Like many smartphone manufacturers, Huawei uses a chemically strengthened Gorilla Glass developed by the US firm Corning to cover the screen to protect it from scratches and breaking. – Cameras – The P30 rivals the other latest smartphone models with three rear-facing cameras. Huawei has beefed up its chops in photography by partnering with Germany’s Leica for designing the cameras for its high-end models, including the P30. The cameras are assembled by China’s Sunny Optical. – Processor – The central processing unit is another area in which Huawei has sought to demonstrate its own technical prowess, developing its own line of Kirin processors, including the 980 used in the P30, but they are manufactured by a Taiwanese company. Other leading smartphone firms like Samsung and Apple have also recently moved to use their own CPUs in their phones. But they all use a common architecture for these chipsets developed by the British firm ARM, which is now a unit of Japan’s Softbank. The dedicated graphics processor also uses ARM architecture. – Memory – The RAM memory used by the processor is made by South Korea’s SK Hynix, although previous versions of Huawei’s top-line phones have used components from the US firm Micron. Micron, like fellow US firms Qualcomm and Intel, has announced it will no longer supply Huawei in line with government directives. – Connectivity – Huawei doesn’t produce the wifi and Bluetooth antennas and modems used in smartphones, the standards of which are decided by associations of manufacturers. The US firms Qualcomm and Intel are the major manufacturers for wifi modems for high-end smartphones. – Operating systems – With the exception of Apple, almost all other smartphones manufacturers use Android, the open source operating system developed by Google. The P30 uses the latest version, 9, called Pie. Like most smartphones companies, Huawei adapts Android slightly to create a unique user experience.

London, United Kingdom | AFP | Huawei’s cyber security chief told the UK parliament Monday that the Chinese telecoms giant has been advised it was under no obligation to spy for Beijing if so asked by the Communist state. John Suffolk told a committee hearing that Huawei has sought guidance from its attorneys to see if a Chinese law on domestic companies’ cooperation with the government on security matters could force it to conduct foreign intelligence work. The legislation has been cited by US President Donald Trump’s administration in its attempts to force governments across the world to drop Huawei from their 5G network development plans. Suffolk’s appearance before the UK parliament’s science and technology committee came as Britain prepares to publish delayed policy guidelines for the next-generation technology’s rollout. “There are no laws in China that obligate us to work with the Chinese government with anything whatsoever,” Suffolk said. “Our legal advice is that is not the case.” Britain and other states are concerned by a series of Chinese laws that include one adopted in June 2017 covering private companies and intelligence matters. Committee member Julian Lewis cited the legislation as saying that Beijing had the power to “request the relevant organs, organisations and civilians to provide necessary support, assistance and cooperation” to various Chinese security agencies. Suffolk said the legislation’s “unclear” wording forced Huawei to consult its Chinese attorneys and advisers at London’s Clifford Chance law firm. “Many countries produce laws that are unclear and we have had to go through a period of clarification with the Chinese government that have come out and made it quite clear that (spying) is not the requirement on any company,” Suffolk said. “We have had that validated again by our lawyers and revalidated again by Clifford Chance. I believe there is no such obligation.” Lewis called Suffolk’s explanation “entirely unbelievable”. – Huawei’s work in Xinjiang – Huawei currently provides the most advanced — and least expensive — 5G technology in the world. It is also widely integrated into Britain’s existing 4G network and has been cooperating with the UK government since 2010 on cyber security threats. UK intelligence agencies have been unable to agree whether it was wiser to “manage” risks by working more closely with Huawei — or to fall behind technologically and wait for Western companies to develop their own 5G systems. The Trump administration has warned that the US may have to stop sharing intelligence with Britain if it builds its new network around Huawei hardware. British lawmakers have been further unnerved by revelations first made by Australian researchers that Huawei’s tecnology was being used to conduct surveillance in China’s restrive Xinjiang region. Chinese authorities have placed an estimated one million mostly Muslim ethnic minorities — including Uighurs — in internment camps with the help of face recognition technology. Suffolk confirmed that Huawei’s equipment was being used by a “partner” in Xinjiang. “Our contracts are with a third party. It is not something we do directly,” he said. Committee members pressed Suffolk on whether he felt “complicit” in wide-scale abuses of human rights. “I don’t think it’s for us to make such judgements,” Suffolk said. “Our judgement is, is it legal within the countries in which we operate. That’s our criteria. It’s for others to make a judgement on whether it’s right or wrong.”

Washington, United States | AFP | Just a few days after returning from his visit to Japan, where he met new Emperor Naruhito, Donald Trump heads to Britain, where Queen Elizabeth II will receive him during a state visit that could be rocky. The US president — who has never hidden his affinity for military honor guards and red-carpet diplomacy — will arrive in London at a moment when the country’s politics are in disarray. Prime Minister Theresa May will soon step down, her party is looking for a successor and Britons are wondering how their “Brexit” from the European Union is going to happen — and what it will mean for them. His last visit to Britain nearly a year ago, which brought tens of thousands of protesters into the streets, was particularly tumultuous after Trump’s criticism of May to The Sun tabloid caused an uproar. Trump’s three-day stay this time around begins on Monday with a ceremony at Buckingham Palace followed by lunch with the queen. That evening, he will be the guest of honor at a state dinner, a privilege also afforded to George W. Bush and Barack Obama. So what kind of attitude will the billionaire Republican adopt on the trip? Will he weigh in further on who should next occupy 10 Downing Street? Will he offer Britons advice on how to leave the EU? As have all his predecessors, he will certainly emphasize the “special relationship” between the United States and Britain. But the rest — as with most things related to POTUS 45 — is hard to predict. “I think President Trump is perhaps looking most forward to his interactions with the royal family,” said Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In the summer of 2018, Trump had tea with Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle, but was not afforded the pomp and circumstance of a state visit. Before he sets foot on British soil, there are multiple calls for protests — and controversy is already brewing. The leader of Britain’s main opposition Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn, declined an invitation to the state dinner in Trump’s honor. He said it wasn’t the time to roll out the red carpet for a president who “rips up vital international treaties, backs climate change denial and uses racist and misogynist rhetoric.” – The ‘excellent’ Boris Johnson – On Tuesday, Trump’s trip will take a decidedly political turn when he sits down with May, just days before she steps down on June 7. While she was the first foreign leader welcomed to the White House after Trump’s election victory in November 2016, their relationship has not always been rosy. Tensions have soared on occasion and the disputes between the two sides are real. “When you look at the US-UK relationship, there’s a lot of bilateral disagreement,” Conley said, naming Iran as a major point of contention, seeing as Britain backs the nuclear deal dumped by Trump. The Paris climate accord, which Trump also abandoned, is also on the list. The US president’s talks with Prince Charles, who is actively pro-environment, could focus on this issue. China and its controversial tech giant Huawei could also be on the agenda, as well as a US-British trade deal, though no concrete progress is expected from this trip. Before heading across the Atlantic, Trump staked a claim to close ties with Boris Johnson, the pro-Brexit favorite in the race to succeed May, and anti-EU populist Nigel Farage. “Nigel Farage is a friend of mine. Boris is a friend of mine. They’re two very good guys, interesting people. I like them,” Trump said. “Maybe it is not my business to support people but I have a lot of respect for both of those men.” He doubled down on Friday, praising Johnson’s bid for the prime minister’s post in an interview with The Sun. “I think Boris would do a very good job. I think he would be excellent,” he said. No meetings are scheduled with Johnson or Farage — for now. The end of Trump’s European trip will focus on the 75th anniversary of D-Day, with a ceremony at Portsmouth also attended by the queen. Trump and his wife Melania will then make a brief stop in Ireland before heading to France on June 6 for the D-Day commemorations in Normandy.

Beijing, China | AFP | A replica of the Palace of Versailles, medieval turrets, and spires rise across Huawei’s new campus in southern China, a monument to the telecom giant’s growing fortune — and the benefits of state aid. The fairytale-like facilities rest on land that was sold by the local government at cut-rate prices to woo and bolster a strategic, high-tech company like Huawei. It is the kind of government largesse that has fanned US frustrations at China’s industrial policies — subsidies are a sticking point in protracted trade talks between the world’s top two economies. Huawei has become a major flashpoint in the trade war, with President Donald Trump taking steps to block the company’s dealings with US companies, threatening its global ambitions. With the dispute shining a spotlight on China’s technological shortcomings, the subsidies are a window into the kind of measures Beijing may step up as trade negotiations founder. Huawei’s annual reports and public records show that it has received hundreds of millions of dollars in grants, heavily subsidised land to build facilities and apartments for loyal employees, bonuses for top engineers, and massive state loans to international customers to fund purchases of Huawei products. “Below market price land sales, massive targeted R&D grants, and export financing on terms that are more favourable than what Huawei could get from the private sector collectively appear to provide significant subsidies that other countries could challenge at the WTO if they are harming domestic companies,” said Claire Reade, a former assistant US trade representative. Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei had denied that the company received subsidies in a BBC interview in February, but a Huawei spokeswoman later said Ren meant the firm did not receive any special government aid. The spokeswoman noted that other companies around the world receive subsidies. “Like other companies, Huawei receives research subsidies from governments in several jurisdictions,” the spokeswoman told AFP, adding that it was “unfair” to suggest it was a key factor in the company’s success. Over the past 10 years, Huawei has received 11 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) in grants, according to its annual reports. More than half was given by China as “unconditional government grants” because of the firm’s “contributions to the development of new high-technology,” according to Huawei’s 2009 annual report. After peaking at 0.8 percent of sales in 2011, the funding has become less significant compared to Huawei’s skyrocketing revenue, the documents show. Some of Huawei’s top engineers receive bonuses through government programmes: more than 100 of them received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the city of Shenzhen last year. Huawei said such incentives are available to staff at other companies. – Bargain-rate lakeside land – Heavily subsidised land is often used by local governments in China to bring in companies. Huawei’s European-inspired campus was zoned for research by the Dongguan city government, and because of Huawei’s status as a top Chinese company, it received the 127 hectares of land at about one-tenth the cost of nearby residential land. The city also sold bargain-rate lakeside land to the firm to build upwards of 20,000 employee apartments around its campus in a series of engineered auctions producing a single bidder: a Huawei subsidiary. From 2015 to 2018, the subsidiary picked up 46 hectares for about one-sixth the going rate, suggesting Huawei saved as much as 16.5 billion yuan on the purchases. Asked about the subsidised land, a company spokeswoman said that Huawei contributed to Dongguan’s economic development and pays taxes. At the Huawei Lakeside Garden complex, employees who stick around for three years and meet other metrics will be able to purchase their apartments at about one-third of the price their neighbours pay. Outside China, the country’s state policy banks have provided financing to boost Huawei’s sales to the developing world — at times leaving the state on the hook when risky loans go bad. Huawei inked a $10 billion credit line with the China Development Bank (CDB) in 2004 to provide low-cost financing to customers buying its telecom gear. It was tripled to $30 billion in 2009. China’s demand for infrastructure, including communications and internet gear, is not as high as it used to be, said CDB President Zheng Zhijie, so “what can we do with the excess production capacity? We can only send it abroad”. “We may give you loans to buy Chinese equipment or materials, but there must be a Chinese element,” Zheng told AFP of his bank’s loans to help Chinese firms expand abroad. Brazilian telecom firm Telemar Norte Leste obtained a $500 million CDB loan in 2009 with a two-year grace period on principal payments at a well-below-market interest rate to buy Huawei gear. This type of loan is known as export credit and primarily regulated under an OECD arrangement incorporated into the World Trade Organisation. But China has refused to sign on or abide by its rules, said Kristen Hopewell, an expert at the University of Edinburgh, adding the credit line for Huawei could be in violation of those rules. Since 2015 China has provided more funding each year to support its exports than the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s 36 member-nations combined, according to US Export-Import Bank data. In late 2015, then struggling Oi S.A., Telemar’s parent company, dispatched an executive team to China to seal a deal with the CDB for $1.2 billion in even cheaper loans — half to buy Huawei gear, and half to refinance debt — with its original loan still on Oi’s books. Six months later Oi filed for Brazil’s largest ever bankruptcy. The CDB was owed $650 million, and under new terms will not see payments until 2023 at an even lower set interest rate. Nevertheless, Oi is working with Huawei to prepare for 5G. Similarly, Indian wireless provider Reliance Communications filed for bankruptcy this spring with the CDB and the Export-Import Bank of China among its largest lenders, while Huawei competitor Ericsson has been left battling for its debts in court. “Most telecom companies are operating really well, one or two telecom companies because of some reason or another may encounter difficulties,” Zheng said. “This is business risk for a bank.

Washington, United States | AFP | The United States and China are in a virtual deadlock in the race for 5G, or fifth-generation wireless networks expected to unlock new services, an industry survey showed Tuesday. The report shows the United States has closed the gap with China in “readiness” for the ultrafast wireless systems and has more 5G deployments planned in 2019 than any other country. The study for the wireless industry group CTIA and conducted by the research firm Analysys Mason showed the US moved ahead of South Korea in 5G readiness over the past year to a virtual tie with China, as a result of considerable investment in 5G systems. CTIA president Meredith Attwell Baker said in a statement that the United States has made “impressive strides” in preparing for the new technology but that more is needed to maintain leadership. “We can’t be complacent as the 5G race has really just begun,” she said. “We must redouble our efforts to combat the 5G ambitions and investments by China and others.” Analysts expect 5G networks to play a crucial role in delivering data for autonomous vehicles, remote medicine and other services with heavy data usage. US officials have sought to block Chinese firms such as Huawei from deploying 5G systems on national security grounds, raising concerns that this will slow the rollout of high-speed networks. Officials have also floated the idea of a government-backed 5G network which could be more secure against foreign espionage, an idea roundly opposed by the telecom industry. According to the report, the US leads with 92 commercial 5G deployments planned for 2019 but noted that China’s wireless operators are conducting “hundreds of large-scale 5G trials across the country.” “China retains a significant infrastructure advantage,” the report said. “A recent study showed China with more than 14 wireless cell sites per 10,000 people, compared to 4.7 in the United States.” The report said to maintain growth in 5G, the US needs to do more to allocate wireless spectrum, in some cases reassigning bands now used for other purposes. According to the survey, South Korea ranked third in 5G readiness, followed by Japan, Britain and Italy.

Paris, France | AFP | France will require telecommunications companies to allow more government oversight and control of the equipment required for next-generation 5G wireless networks due to security concerns, a government official said Tuesday. The move comes as several Western nations have barred China’s Huawei from participating in contracts for 5G deployment, citing fears Beijing could gain access to sensitive communications and critical infrastructure. Guillaume Poupard, head of France’s national cybersecurity agency ANSSI, said a new law could be enacted soon to “toughen and extend” authorisation requirements “to be sure we control the entire 5G network”. But he said approvals would not be refused “because of a company’s image, or its country of origin”. “There aren’t good equipment makers on the one hand and bad equipment makers on the other — unfortunately the situation is much more complex,” Poupard told AFP on the sidelines of the International Cybersecurity Forum in Lille, northern France. The need for oversight is all the more critical since the base stations and other infrastructure for ultrafast 5G networks are much less centralised than current 4G systems, he said. The new network promises nearly instantaneous transfers of huge amounts of data, paving the way for self-driving cars or remotely accessed sensors in an array of consumer and health products. Huawei has invested billions of dollars in the technology, competing mainly against Sweden’s Ericsson and Finland’s Nokia. But the United States, Britain and other countries have said Huawei represents a security risk, not least since its founder Ren Zhengfei is a former People’s Liberation Army engineer. BT, Britain’s largest mobile provider, said in December it was removing Huawei equipment from its 4G cellular network. Tensions escalated in December after Canada arrested Huawei’s chief financial officer — Ren’s daughter — on a US arrest warrant over suspected Iran sanctions violations. The company’s chairman Liang Hua said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday that it would pull out of partnerships in hostile countries. “We do not pose a threat to a future digital society,” Liang told reporters, adding the United States had not put forward any evidence to justify its claim that Huawei equipment could serve as a Trojan horse for Beijing’s security apparatus. But if Huawei gets barred from certain markets and customers start to shun it, “we will transfer technology partnerships to countries where we are welcome and where we can have a collaboration”, he added.
