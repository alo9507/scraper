The Kenya School of Government in collaboration with the Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) are working on a unique creative arts development curriculum which aims to support youth innovation centres across the country to become sources of jobs and wealth creation. The partnership, which started with the launch of a youth empowerment centre, in Isiolo in October, is meant to use film and arts as tools for youth empowerment. The aim of the founders of the initiative is to encourage talented youths from the grassroots to pursue their creativity to create jobs and ensure they are not condemned to misery and depression just because they are not gifted in academics. According to KFCB CEO Ezekiel Mutua, the nine-month curriculum will be hands-on and will be conducted virtually, although the final three months will entail practicals where learners will be expected to produce real products in their chosen areas. “We expect anyone who joins the course to learn music and to be able to produce a song and a feature film to qualify for graduation,” said Dr Mutua. Funding challenges Dr Mutua said that most potential film makers in Kenya lack funding, technical skills and understanding of how the market works. This disenfranchises many talented youths who see their creativity and passion go to waste, he said. Additionally, many are hampered by the fact that filmmaking is an expensive venture. According to Dr Mutua, not many youths are able to raise enough capital for training, let alone investing in film as a business, unlike in places such as the United States, India, China and several western countries. At the same time, there are very few film schools in Kenya and the ones that exist are way beyond the affordability of ordinary young Kenyans. This is where this partnership comes in, said Dr Mutua. KFCB and the Kenya School of Government’s partnership aims supporting youths to acquire training and linking them with the international market through technology. “We hope to leverage on new technologies to help our youths to market their films globally,” said Dr Mutua when he opened the one-week retreat for creative arts curriculum development and harmonisation at Lake Naivasha Resort. Talent-based The programme will be talent-based as opposed to academic qualifications. “It’s about passion for creativity as opposed to academic qualifications,” he reiterated. The two government bodies have already selected a team of specialists to come up with a solid curriculum for the beneficiaries of the programme. According to Dr Mutua, two teams, each from KFCB and KSG, have been selected to develop the curriculum and guide its implementation. The nine-month training scheduled to begin in January 2021 will see 50 youths enjoy a full scholarship from the KFClB to undertake the course which will be executed through the Kenya School of Government. The programme will benefit youths aged between 18-35 years, and the qualifications for admission will be passion and motivation in diverse genres of art such as photography, film, music and comedy among others. The programme has already attracted the support of UNDP, Huawei and other donors. KFCB hopes to roll out such training across all counties in the country and is already in communication with the county governments of Kakamega, Siaya, Mombasa, Machakos, Kiambu, Homa Bay and Kisii to replicate the curriculum in their regions. Online course The programme will be coordinated by renowned film producer and trainer Rachael Wainaina. It will entail a six-month online course work and three-months practicals in which the trainees will be expected to produce works of art based on their areas of interest, talent and expertise that they will have acquired during the six-month course. “The creative economy is a major frontier of job creation and with Covid-19 pandemic necessitating a shift to increased use of technology for business, that is why we have structured the programme this way,” said Ms Wainaina. Besides Ms Wainaina, others charged with the curriculum’s implementation are KFCB’s Joel Wamalwa (manager, licence and compliance), Nelly Muluka, (corporate communications), Paul Mbui (manager, Nairobi Film Festival Centre) and Marcos Masuga (head of licensing). From the Kenya School of Government there is Jane Mwangi (head of curriculum), Elizabeth Owino (principal lecturer), Peter Quest, the head of Youth Empowerment Centre and Guru Wario a researcher. © 2020, The Chronicle of Education.

The Ministry of Higher Education Science Technology and Innovation signed last Wednesday a memorandum with the Chinese multinational Huawei. The agreement aims to develop a set of actions that contribute to the development of a training and talent training plan in the field of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in higher education institutions in Angola. According to the minister of Higher Education Science Technology and Innovation, Rosária Bragança Sambo, the memorandum will allow for improvements in human training and infrastructure in the higher education subsystem. “This memo provides for the training of teachers and staff, as well as the provision of ICTs in higher education institutions”, he said. The agreement foresees that Huawei supports with equipment so that courses in the areas of technology can have full accreditation in terms of teaching and learning. The minister said that, although the covid-19 pandemic is occurring worldwide, the agreement was signed and hopes that this will not hinder the evolution of the teaching methodology using information technologies. To the official, many higher education institutions ended up engaging in distance learning process. To the chairman of Huawei’s board of directors, Edric Chu, the Angolan market is one of the first in Africa and this agreement will help to dynamize higher education institutions to make the best use of new information technologies. He also said that the company has a technology park under construction in the Talatona area (Luanda), which will consist of technical training, innovation and experience centers – an investment estimated at 60 million Kwanzas. The act, witnessed by several ministerial directors, also counted on the distinction of the six best employees of the ministry, who participated in the course in the area of new information technologies given by Huawei. © 2020, The Chronicle of Education.

Harmony Agere Investigations Reporter LIVE by the sword, die by the sword! This aptly captures the bloody shootout between the Zimbabwe Republic Police and a notorious gang of armed robbers, five of whom died in the fire exchange in Harare. One of the suspected robbers, Stanely Mateko, survived the shooting and was placed under hospital custody by magistrate Ms Rumbidzai Mugwagwa. The other two surviving robbers — Godfrey Mupamhanga (27) and Prince Zakeo (25), both of Highfield — were denied bail and are languishing in remand prison. The three are thought to be part of a gang of 10 armed robbers led by feared crime lord Musa Taj Abdul and have been on the police wanted list for two decades. Abdul is believed to have escaped to his hideout in South Africa, where he has orchestrated high-profile heists in Zimbabwe since August last year. According to national police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi, the gang allegedly committed nine robberies. Some of the latest alleged spate of robberies include the movie-style heist on forex dealers at Makoni Shopping Centre in Chitungwiza in February. Information on gang leader Abdul, who is also known as Musa Mohammed or Kedha, is still thin on the ground but sources claim he has previously worked with other notorious armed robbers such as Gift “Tyres” Mwale, who was gunned down in a shootout with police 11 years ago. Abdul has managed to evade the long arm of the law for so long after leaving the country for South Africa where he is believed to be linking up with other armed robbers who have ambitions to scale up operations to a regional level. According to our sources, the only time that Abdul is in the country is to execute well-planned and thought-out heists smash and grab style. It has been claimed that his network includes well-paid informants as well as police officers, who regularly leak investigation details. In South Africa, Abdul is thought to have been arrested several times but released with the help of his police connections. “The rest of the gang members are young unemployed boys recruited here in Zimbabwe or South Africa,” said a source. “Police are closely looking at him. He has made a lot of mistakes lately, one more error and he will be gone. He has probably managed to bribe some police officers in the past to get information, but it is now too risky because he is attracting attention from the highest offices.” Since August last year, Abdul is alleged to have commanded a gang of no less than 10 robbers armed with lethal rifles such as the AK47. According to a police charge sheet, arrested gang members are facing four counts of armed robbery and unlawful possession of firearms. Investigating officer Detective Assistant Inspector Simbarashe Maruziva revealed that the value of property stolen and potential prejudice amounts to US$375 150, ZAR 50 300 and ZW$62 000. The notorious gang hit its targets starting from December 20 2019 at around 3.30pm, demanding cash and valuables. In one of the heists, the gang allegedly pounced on Culdees Honye (33), Wilfred Motsi (51) and Cornelius Mutandwa at Wessec Sol Enterprises. Another victim is Brighton Chigura (29). The robbers pointed firearms at Honye and ordered her to lie down before they grabbed Motsi, who was a customer making inquiries, searched him and took his Tecno Spark 4 and Samsung cellphones. Honye then showed the robbers the location of two safes containing US$14 000, ZW$150 240 and ZAR 21 500. The robbers took the two safes and loaded them into an Isuzu KB 240 single cab truck owned by Motsi. The other robber took money from the till and grabbed Motsi’s Tecno Spark 3 cellphone and Tecno tablet. The gang also confronted Mutandawa, a security guard with Fawcett Security, and disarmed him of his service firearm, a 38mm Rossi revolver with five live rounds of ammunition. They drove away in the stolen vehicle which was later found abandoned in the Arcturus area together with the two safes which had been forcibly opened. In another case, the gang broke into one Jealous Chuma’s house on December 30 2019 at around 11pm. While inside they assaulted Chuma with logs and shovels demanding cash and valuables. The robbers ransacked the house and stole a 20-litre bucket containing ZW$25 000, US$900 and ZAR 800 which was in a cashbox inside the bedroom and vanished with it. On the third occasion, the famous heist on Makoni forex dealers, the gang pounced on Jairos Jeke (33) and his brother, Simbisai (30). They allegedly drove to Makoni Shopping Centre aboard a white Toyota Hilux Double Cab on February 5 2020 at around 2pm. Upon arrival, they fired several shots into the air from their pistols and an AK47 rifle before confronting the victims, whom they assaulted with metal bars demanding cash and valuables. One of the robbers, who was brandishing an iron bar, broke Jairos’ motor vehicle windows — a Toyota Allion — and ordered him to surrender his firearm. The gang then searched Simbisai’s motor vehicle and took a bag, which had ZW$37 000 and a Samsung S9. They allegedly barged into Jairos’ car and drove off at high speed following their getaway vehicle towards Dema. In Jairos’ vehicle, the robbers took US$7 000 and two small Nokia cellphones. The total amount stolen was US$12 000 and ZW$37 000 — nothing was recovered. In the fourth case, the gang pounced on Rodney Dangarembizi (40), Dumisani Moses Dube, Tinashe Masango (28), Faith Nyambirai (27) and Betty Chitando (22). Operating in usual style, the gang allegedly approached their targets on February 26 2020 at around 7.50am. They confronted Dangarembizi, who was standing beside his motor vehicle in his garage at home. They assaulted him with open hands demanding cash and valuables before taking US$3 000 from his pockets. The robbers demanded more cash and force-marched Dangarembizi into his main house which they ransacked and stole US$37 000 cash, jewellery, several shoes, an Apple laptop and car keys which were in his bedroom. They went on to open a gun cabinet where they stole a 9mm Star pistol and 120 rounds of ammunition. They also stole a Samsung AZ core and a Huawei Nova 4, which were in the house. They force-marched Dangarembizi at gunpoint to his garage where they ordered him into his Honda Fit. The other robber took charge of a white Hyundai belonging to the businessman. The gang then demanded to know the whereabouts of Tawanda Nyambirai, who is the owner of TN Holdings situated next to Dangarembizi’s home. Dangarembizi led the gang to TN Holdings premises where they confronted other complainants. The gang searched Dumisani Dube and stole US$250, an HP laptop and his Samsung J1. The robbers demanded to be taken to the offices of the company’s CEO and the location of his safe. Dube led the accused to the CEO’s offices situated on the second floor. They forced open the office’s door and stole a Chubb safe with US$180 000 cash and an Acer laptop. The robbers loaded the safe into a Hyundai vehicle, which they had stolen from Dangarembizi and drove away. They later dumped the two stolen vehicles at Mazowe Citrus kiosk ion the Harare-Bindura road. Dangarembizi lost US$227 250, ZAR 28 000 and two motor vehicles valued at US$10 000.

Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa (L) shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping as they pose for the media after a signing ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on April 3, 2018. Mnangagwa is on a visit to China to seek economic support from a major partner that previously backed his ousted predecessor Robert Mugabe. / AFP PHOTO / POOL / Parker Song Tawanda Musarurwa The Zimbabwean economy will emerge the biggest winner following President Mnangagwa’s attendance at the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China – Africa Co-operation (FOCAC). With Chinese President Xi Jinping tabling a $60 billion facility for African countries, Zimbabwe has already lined up solid projects to access the funding and expedite their implementation. President Xi said the financing will be provided in the form of Government assistance as well as investment and financing by financial institutions and companies. Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Dr Sibusiso Moyo said at least three projects have been lined up. These include the NetOne expansion project, Hwange 7 and 8 expansion, and upgrade of the Robert Mugabe International Airport. “In April, the key projects which were approved were, firstly, Hwange 7 and 8, and you are aware that a ground-breaking ceremony was done by His Excellency. The second project is the Robert Mugabe International Airport upgrade and that expansion is already underway, there has been a ground-breaking ceremony; and the third one is the NetOne expansion, which is also already underway. “What is important for now is that there is clarity of accessibility of funds within FOCAC. The manner in which this was presented by President Xi was such that you can only be a nation that fails itself in terms of accessing these funds. But these (projects) are available, they have clarity of procedure,” he said. Minister Moyo said the private sector should not be left behind in accessing part of the $60 billion facility. The facility will see China implementing eight major initiatives with African countries in the next three years and beyond. The projects will cover industrial promotion, infrastructure connectivity, trade facilitation and green development. Minister Moyo said the private sector only needs to present clear, bankable projects. “The projects are all market-oriented, except where the funds are concerned and it means there must be proper feasibility studies. It means both Government and the private sector should really come up with world-class feasibility studies that are firm and viable and this is so that projects can be self-sustaining within the framework of project finance mechanisms,” he said. Notwithstanding the available concessionary loans, Zimbabwe is hoping to utilise China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to better integrate in the global economy. China is one of the most powerful economies in the world. President Mnangagwa said the BRI is in line with Vision 2030, which will see Zimbabwe achieving middle-income status in twelve years to come. The Southern African nation must achieve a gross domestic product (GDP) level of over $65 billion by 2030 to attain this status. Countries with per capita gross national incomes of between $996 and $12 195 fall under this category. Zim feeds into BRI China’s Belt and Road Initiative is an ambitious effort to improve regional co-operation and connectivity on a trans-continental scale. It is meant to strengthen connectivity, deepen economic co-operation based on each other’s strengths and to seek mutual development. The Belt and Road is in line with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, in as far as it upholds the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, mutual respect for each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, equality, mutual benefit and peaceful co-existence. The BRI thrives on the basis of mutual benefits and win-win co-operation. The initiative involves China underwriting billions of dollars of infrastructure investment in countries along the old Silk Road. China is spending roughly $150 billion a year in the 68 countries that have signed up under the scheme. President Mnangagwa said the BRI is a significant enhancement of the old Silk Road — an ancient trade route that linked China with a network of countries in Europe, Asia and Africa. “The Road and Belt Initiative has taken everybody on board so that our economies can talk to each other, so that our economies can help each other modernise and mechanise. We are getting connected and benefiting from each other. “If you look at the current FOCAC meeting, there are issues that we are going to deal with. There is the issue of transportation and infrastructure development, among many others. “We believe that all this can be done considering the relationship under FOCAC, where the rest of Africa is making conversation with China, and China is helping Zimbabwe and Africa to develop. This creates the integration of marketing in China and Africa. We we are happy that we are part of this global vision. We in Zimbabwe are committed to the BRI and we do not want Zimbabwe to be left behind because we want to be linked to global markets and the global economy,” President Mnangagwa said. Results from bilateral meetings Following the conclusion of the FOCAC 2018 Summit, President Mnangagwa met with his Chinese counterpart, President Xi. Several agreements were made during the bilateral meetings. These are expected to further economic collaboration between the two countries, particularly with regards to agriculture. Foreign Affairs Minister Dr Moyo outlined the major outcomes of the bilateral meetings. “The second agreement was to do with the commitment by China to import citrus fruits from Zimbabwe. The obligation will obviously remain with our producers here in Zimbabwe to be able to generate adequate produce which should satisfy the demand of China. One of the issues that was discussed was a possibility of reverse investment integration, where the market itself — the Chinese market — would come here to support the producers in order to create capacity of production to allow exportation to China. We already have the precedence of contract farming in the tobacco sector,” said Minister Moyo. “The last agreement was that of 500 boreholes, which were donated by the Chinese government. These boreholes are meant to supplement water in areas experiencing a deficit. We have had previous support of around 300 boreholes, now they have added 500 boreholes.” More Chinese firms eye Zim During the visit, several Chinese businesses and organisations lined up to engage President Mnangagwa to express their willingness to invest in Zimbabwe. The Chinese businesses that have expressed interest to invest in Zimbabwe include Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, a global leader in consumer electronics; TBEA, which specialises in electricity generation, transmission and distribution. TBEA has expressed interest in Zimbabwe’s power transmission and distribution projects. The President also met with and signed a memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Belt and Road Collaborative Innovation Centre (BRCIC). Earlier in April, the chairman of the BRCIC met President Mnangagwa and offered scholarships to Zimbabwean students. Other Chinese businesses that met with the President include Yantai JinAO Protection Technology Co, a gold mining company involved in refractory gold ore extraction and processing; the Touchroad International Holdings Group, which is involved in special economic zone development, resources exploitation, finance and international trade and China Gezhouba Group Company Limited & CGGC, which is one of the largest comprehensive solutions providers for the power industry in China and globally. Other companies include China Gold, CCCC, a diversified group and 21 Century Space Technology Co Limited, which is involved in the construction industry.

Treasury is processing urgent paperwork to receive nearly US$2 billion, which is part of a package extended to Zimbabwe by China during President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s visit to the Asian giant a fortnight ago. In addition, a $4 billion deal is under discussion as Tsingshan Group – already operating in Zimbabwe as AfroChine (chrome) – seeks to establish a stainless steel processing plant. Tsingshan Group is the world’s biggest producer of stainless steel. In another development that bears testimony the deals are no monkey business, a high-level Chinese delegation is expected in Harare tomorrow to follow up on potential areas of co-operation in the wake of President Mnangagwa’s State visit. Companies that benefited from the US$2 billion deals last week told The Sunday Mail that exciting times are beckoning as their projects will kick off after Chinese banks agreed to the immediate release of funds for Hwange Thermal Power Station’s units 7 and 8, Robert Mugabe International Airport’s expansion and NetOne’s Phase 3 extension. President Mnangagwa’s administration also received special bonuses from President Xi Jinping of RMB1 billion and US$20 million, which will soon go directly into Zimbabwe’s reserves. Documents availed by Treasury last week showed the first tranche of the $1 billion Hwange deal is due any time from now, and the will be implemented over three-and-a-half years. The expansion of Robert Mugabe International Airport is expected to start immediately, as Finance and Economic Development Minister Patrick Chinamasa had already signed the financing arrangement. NetOne’s US$71 million expansion is well on course with US$10 million already injected and the remainder on its way. Kunzvi Dam is also taking shape, with China Communication Construction Company and Sino Hydro poised to invest US$400 million. CCCC is the world’s largest construction firm, while Sino Hydro recently completed expansion of Kariba South Hydro Power Station at a cost of $533 million, adding 300MW of electricity to the national grid. In an interview with The Sunday Mail last week, Cde Chinamasa said Treasury has initiated procedures to receive the money. “With respect to the US$1 billion Hwange 7 and 8, US$ 153 million for Robert Mugabe International and US$71 million for NetOne Phase 3 expansion, I can safely say that these are done deals. We are now just processing the papers to receive the money. “What is important is that we reached agreement with China Eximbank and Sinosure, which insures all Chinese investments outside of China.” According to documents availed from Treasury, other funds destined for Zimbabwe’s coffers include a RMB1 billion (about $160 million) grant which will be available from 2018 to 2020. Treasury documents also show that Government has access to RMB80 million (about $12,5 million) for rice, RMB20 million (about $3 million) for agriculture expertise, RMB33 million (about $5,2 million) for a High Performance Computer Centre, and RMB700 000 (about US$110 000) for 500 boreholes. This is money that had been set aside for 2015-2017 but had not been paid out for varying reasons. Speaking to The Sunday Mail, ICT and Cyber Security Minister Supa Mandiwanzira, who was part of the delegation to China, said the NetOne Phase 3 expansion was a done deal after it received the highest guarantee possible from President Xi. “President Xi personally assured the delegation led by His Excellency President Mnangagwa that the fund is now available to Zimbabwe,” he said. “In order to demonstrate the confidence, Huawei, which is implementing the project, has already advanced about $10 million. “That upfront payment is supporting the deployment of infrastructure across the country. The equipment is already now on the seas. The paperwork for the remaining $61 million is being finalised to ensure that the full amount is released.” NetOne chief executive Mr Lazarus Muchenje said the US$71 million concessionary loan would boost the company’s operations. “The Chinese President was satisfied with the presentations done by the Zimbabwean President. The two Presidents’ meeting enhanced the confidence of the Chinese President for investment in Zimbabwe,” he said. “NetOne will increase its competitiveness in the mobile sector through broader network coverage, better data network and value for money products. This project will bring cutting edge data services to some of the marginalised communities enabling them to bridge the digital divide.” Secretary for Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Mr George Magosvongwe said Musami-Kunzvi Dam construction had received a kiss of life. “We are working with China Communication Construction Company, Sino Hydro and also City of Harare for the construction of the dam, a water treatment plant and installation of smart prepaid meters. “The construction will be done under public-private partnerships. We are looking at around $400 million for the water deal.” Zesa spokesperson Mr Fullard Gwasira said Hwange 7 and 8 expansion would start immediately. On the envisaged $4 billion stainless steel investment, Mines and Mining Development Minister Mr Winston Chitando said: “Zimbabwe has set itself a strategic objective of having a stainless steel plant in the country. Preliminary discussions with potential players have and will take place over the next few weeks and more communication will be made at the appropriate time.” Special Advisor to the President, Ambassador Christopher Mutsvangwa, said Tsingshan chair Mr Xiang Guangda’s meeting with President Mnangagwa had encouraged the Chinese tycoon after his first investment attempt failed to yield results under Mr Robert Mugabe’s administration. “Mr Xiang came to Zimbabwe in 2014 and said Zimbabwe has all the ingredients of making stainless steel within 200 to 300 kilometres of each other “So he revived the offer to President Mnangagwa who gave him all the assurances that he needs. He is now busy putting together a package for building the largest stainless steel plan Africa has ever known, worth about $4 billion.” Zimbabwe Investment Authority chief executive Mr Richard Mubaiwa said a delegation from China would arrive tomorrow. “We are having a Chinese delegation visiting from Monday to Friday, responding to the recent State visit,” he said. “They are following up to look at potential areas of where they can invest. “They have specific interest in the energy sector and infrastructure developments. So we have made appointments for them with ZERA and Zesa, and IDBZ.”

The Anti Counterfeit Agency (ACA) conducted a raid on Monday in shops along Luthuli Avenue in downtown Nairobi and confiscated fake mobile phones and accessories valued at over Ksh8 million. Among the accessories confiscated when the agency raided the shops after a complaint by phone manufacturer Samsung were chargers, batteries, phone covers, and earphones. Speaking after the raid Ibrahim Bule, the chief inspector ACA reported that five suspects were apprehended in the operation and also urged other brands to come out and assist them in fighting fake goods. “This is a crackdown that will continue. The agency has now focused completely on cracking down on all illicit and counterfeit products and will get rid of all of them from the market,” added Bule. The phones that were seized had been rebranded using names from popular brands including Samsung, HTC, Nokia, Huawei, and Sony. The Suspects were taken to Central Police Station, Nairobi and are aiding the police with investigations. On February 26, the ACA had conducted another raid along Tom Mboya street and seized another bunch of fake phones with an estimated market value of Ksh3 million. ACA chief inspector disclosed that the war on counterfeits is aimed at protecting the consumers against the adverse effects of using substandard products and by supporting the government’s anti-counterfeitwar to create a win-win outcome not only for consumers but also the government. Bule further went on to reiterate that the trading of counterfeited goods affects the government as they lose billions of shilling in taxes. State Department of Trade, PS Dr. Chris Kiptoo noted that unfair trade practices negatively impact on the country’s economy, ease of doing business and the local manufacturing industry. These losses have also touched the public sector as illicit and counterfeited trade has enabled the evasion of payment of huge amounts of taxes with each passing financial year.

A Deputy Minister of Communications, Mr George Andah, has advised institutions managing personal data to help prevent identity theft by taking extreme caution in how such data are used. “There is the need to protect personal data and the right to privacy. It is vital that personal data held by organisations, businesses and government institutions are accurate and used for the purposes they are collected,” he said. “More important, proper data protection procedures have to be followed. This is essential in helping to curtail cybercrime by ensuring that personal data is protected from misuse by third party fraud such as identity theft,” he added at the 2019 Huawei Internet Protocol (IP) gala in Accra yesterday. Identity Identity theft, also known as identity fraud, is a crime in which an imposter obtains key pieces of personally identifiable information, such as automated teller machine card or driver’s license numbers, in order to impersonate someone else. The information can be used to obtain credit, merchandise and services in the name of the victim, or to provide the thief with false credentials. Mr Andah noted that as the country sped up its digitisation efforts and embraced technological advancement, it needed to walk hand-in-hand with adherence to safety and hygienic cyber security practices. He said the Ministry of Communications, realising the dangers, had undertaken a number of initiatives and activities, including the establishment of a National Cyber Security Governance Framework, to enhance the country’s emergency response ecosystem. The gala, christened “Rethink IP for Digital Economy”, brought together more than 150 information communication technology (ICT) and telecoms industry experts from leading operators, enterprises, and top global experts from Huawei to discuss and engage on technological developments in the ICT space. It also provided the opportunity for the Chinese information technology giant to pitch some of its ICT products and solutions, including network security, routers, switches, wireless area network, and campus network solution. ICT Academy Huawei, in December last year, launched the Huawei ICT Training Academy, an ICT Talent Ecosystem Programme for Ghana. More than 600 students and professionals have benefited from its various training programmes in IP aimed at developing Ghana’s ICT talent pool, while giving the technology industry the opportunity to enhance and polish ICT skills to meet the increasing domestic and global demand. Talent The Managing Director of Huawei Ghana, Mr Tommy Zhouwei, said the company saw itself as a Ghanaian company, hence the sense of responsibility to improve ICT levels in Ghana, stressing that “IP is just one part of a big programme to develop more Ghanaian talents in ICT”. With Ghana struggling to bridge a rural-urban digital gap, he said Huawei was working with local IT companies to develop rural telephony in Ghana at reduced costs. He said communication was a human right and the right to use the Internet should be comparable to breathing. According to Huawei figures, more than 2.7 million Ghanaians are yet to be connected to the Internet, and he said having skilled personnel was as important as deploying infrastructure that would bridge the gap. Huawei IP Club Meanwhile, Huawei Ghana has launched the Huawei Ghana IP Club which has the aim to keep the conversation going through the establishment of a common and easy-to-access platform for engagements and continuous learning for both existing and aspiring IP professionals. It will serve as a platform for industry collaboration and cooperation mainly geared towards joint innovation and continuous improvement to drive industry growth. The Huawei Ghana IP Club will seek to strengthen the IP industry and empower players in the field to be skilled, equipped and globally competitive. Source: Graphic.com

BuddeComm’s Telecoms Maturity Index for this year indicates that from a second position last year, Ghana has been completely displaced from the top three and even not listed among the market challengers. The rankings for 2019 showed Mauritius still maintained its lead from last year, as the most matured telecom market on the continent with a 49 score, while Algeria displaced Ghana for the second position with 43 points and South Africa also kicked Tunisia off the third place with a 34-point score. BuddeComm’s Telecoms Maturity Index analyses the broadband, mobile & fixed line markets of a country on top of a range of economic parameters to rank it on a scale of 1 to 100 and compare it to its region. The 2019 market leaders: Mauritius remains the top-ranking country in Africa with a Telecoms Maturity Index score of 49, followed by Algeria (43) and South Africa (34). BuddeComm’s Telecoms Maturity Index measures and ranks the maturity of a country’s telecoms industry on a scale of 1 to 100. All countries are placed into one of three categories: ‘Market Leaders’, ‘Market Challengers’ and ‘Market Laggards’, according to their Market Index score. In Mauritius, the thriving tourism market has stimulated the broadband sector. There is an extensive DSL infrastructure and operators have deployed fibre-based services in a number of localities. Mauritius Telecom invested Rs5.1 billion to roll out fibre across the island. Fibre is available to about 85% of the company’s fixed broadband customer base. In Algeria, Mobilis, one of the 3 major mobile operators, has contracted Huawei as a partner for its network migration to 5G. Mobile penetration approaches 116% and mobile internet accounts for about 92% of all internet connections in the country. In South Africa, mobile penetration by early 2019 approached 169%, driven partly by the popularity of multiple card use as also by the take-up of mobile broadband services. Mobile internet accounts for about 95% of all internet connections Market challengers: The top 3 market challengers are Libya with a score of 23, Lesotho (20.5) and Zimbabwe (20.2). Last year, the top challengers were Mauritania (13), Uganda (13) and Kenya (12). Developing nations: Among the developing markets, the top three countries are Burundi (9.4) Uganda (9.3) and Nigeria (9.1). Last year, the developing markets were Angola (7) Chad (7) and Cameroon (6). Mobile telephony remains by far the dominant telecom service across Africa, accounting for more than 90% of all telephone lines on the continent. Given the very poor condition of fixed-line infrastructure in most markets, mobile internet access as a consequence also accounts for between 95% and 99% of all internet connections. The size and range of the diverse markets within Africa have contributed to varied market penetration rates between countries. By early 2018 the highest mobile penetration was found in countries including South Africa (169%), Botswana (160%) and Mauritius (147%). To some degree high penetration reflects the popularity of consumers having multiple SIM cards despite efforts among most regulators to enforce measures by which operators must register SIM card users.
