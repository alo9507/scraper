We are now putting together the relevant legal framework to cater for the licensing of players and oversight of the trade in commodities,\u201d said Mr Muthaura.\nThe establishment of national commodities exchanges by the EAC member states is a pioneer to the joint regional commodities exchange that will link Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda as part of the Northern Corridor infrastructure projects (NCIP).\nJoint commodities exchange\nThe three countries agreed on the need to run a joint commodities exchange and warehouse receipting system, to ensure transparency in standards and pricing of farm produce.\nKenya has hired a consultant to help set up its national commodities exchange which is expected to be up and running by the end of 2018.\nAccording to the State Department of Trade, the commodities exchange will start trading in maize, wheat, sorghum, millet and coffee in the initial phase followed by tea, cow peas, dry beans, groundnuts and pigeon peas in the second phase.\nIn addition, the exchange will start trading in non-agricultural products when it is fully operational.\nKenya has been blamed by its regional counterparts for falling behind in enacting legislation to facilitate the establishment of a market to stabilise the prices of agricultural produce.\nRwanda already has a functional commodities exchange that is private sector-driven.\nTrading regulations\nThe heads of state of Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda agreed that each country sets up its own commodities exchange but harmonise trading regulations with the rest of the member states.\nKenya\u2019s presidential taskforce on the reform of the coffee sub-sector in 2016 recommended that the National Coffee Exchange (NCE) be regulated under the CMA\u2019s framework, and parliamentarians through the Finance Bill 2016 amended the Capital Markets Act to allow the authority to regulate the commodities markets in the country.\nThe taskforce questioned the validity of the current trading rules of the coffee auction which has locked out farmers from the market leaving the pricing of their produce to be determined by a cartel consisting of millers, marketing agents and dealers.\nAccording to the report the coffee exchange faces legal, financial and operation constraints that hinder its effectiveness.\n\u201cIts legal status is unclear and the validity of the trading rules is questionable. The NCE has serious limitations that impede its effectiveness as an independent, reliable and transparent exchange,\u201d according to the report dated May 2016.\nThe taskforce recommended that the NCE be upgraded to a fully fledged commodities exchange under the CMA. This will include licensing of brokers to receive selling or buying instructions from clients (farmers, co-operatives, companies, millers, and traders).\nUpgrading the NCE is expected to radically alter the coffee industry structure to raise the farmers\u2019 (and country\u2019s) earnings by enabling him/her to sell coffee globally at lower transaction costs.\nCurrently, 90 per cent of coffee is traded at the NCE. The rest is sold through the direct sale window.\nThe ownership of NCE is vested in Agriculture Fisheries and Food Authority (AFFA), and held in trust of the coffee sub sector by the AFFA.\nChallenges\nAccording to the taskforce, the coffee sub-sector is facing unprecedented challenges which have drastically affected production levels.\nThese include low earnings from coffee despite its premium quality, delayed coffee payments, mismanagement and inefficiencies in co-operatives, restrictive coffee laws, high cost of production and lack of direct access to the trading floor.\nOn the other hand tea sales on the Mombasa Tea Auction are currently held under the self-regulating rules and regulations of the East African Tea Trade Association EATTA which consists of about 240 members across the tea industry.\nThe Mombasa market is dominated by a few large buyers mainly from Pakistan, Egypt and the UK.\nKenya plans to convert various publicly and privately \u2013owned entities into warehouses for the proposed market. These include the Kenya National Trading Corporation, National Cereals and Produce Board, Kenya Farmers Association and the Kenya Planters Co-operative Union Ltd.\nThe warehouse receipting system is expected to help farmers access credit from financial institutions using their harvests as collateral.\nRelated stories", "comments": "0", "shares": "0"}

Before dropping to $100 in October 2016, a pint of blood was pegged at $135 \u2014 figures that were beyond the reach of many, resulting in many deaths. Speaking to The Herald yesterday, Dr Parirenyatwa said the latest development was part of his 100-day plan to make health services, blood included, not only available, but also accessible to all.\n\u201cWe want to make sure that all health services are not only available, but also accessible to everyone and with effect from tomorrow (today) the cost of a pint of blood will be $50. We have availed a subsidy of $4,2 million to the NBSZ (National Blood Services Zimbabwe) for them to meet some of the costs associated with blood collection and processing,\u201d said Dr Parirenyatwa.\nHe said his ministry was looking forward to reducing the cost to $10 a pint.\n\u201cThis is an important landmark for us in the health sector as we aim to hit our 100-day target,\u201d said Dr Parirenyatwa.\nHe said since the Health Levy was collected each month, Government was looking forward to continuing to support the NBSZ to ensure sustainability of the reduced price. Government is collecting at least $4 million every month from the cellphone levy, the majority of which is used to procure medicines. A five percent allowance is deducted from every $1 worth of airtime and is then channelled towards the health levy.\nCommenting on other issues of governance within the NBSZ that were contributing to blood donor apathy that resulted in the dwindling of the blood bank towards the end of 2017, Dr Parirenyatwa said Government has ordered the institution to hold its Extraordinary General Meeting before the end of this month (January).\n\u201cWe have asked them to make sure that they hold an EGM before the end of January and that is where we are going to resolve all issues of governance, including the leadership squabbles,\u201d said Dr Parirenyatwa.\nNBSZ public affairs manager Ms Esther Massundah affirmed that blood would be sold for $50 to all public health institutions starting from today. She, however, could not confirm if the reductions have also been effected in the private sector, which is currently buying blood at $120 from NBSZ.\n\u201cThe position with regards to the private sector would be clearer soon after the holidays, but special focus was on Government institutions which consume 80 percent of our products,\u201d said Ms Massundah.\nShe said internally, NBSZ implemented cost-cutting measures, which also saw its annual budget dropping from $9 million to $7,8 million. Commenting on the latest reduction, renowned Harare lawyer who is also a blood donor, Mr Rodgers Matsikidze welcomed the development as a step in the right direction.\n\u201cThat is very positive news as we begin the year and this is evidence that it is possible for the price of blood to go to even zero,\u201d said Mr Matsikidze.\nHe said the next step for Government should be to ensure that patients with chronic illnesses, pregnant women, children under the age of five years and the elderly should get blood for free.\nHe said Government should also make provisions for those who cannot afford to pay for blood completely to get it for free. Specialist surgeon Dr Junica Dari, who is also a blood donor, applauded Government for the price reductions saying many lives would be saved. Dr Dari said on many occasions patients would die as they failed to pay for blood.\n\u201cAll general surgeries, ophthalmology, neuro, orthopaedic, gynaecology and all other major surgeries require at least four units of blood. The majority of maternal patients also require additional blood and blood cancer patients require at least three units of blood every month. Some of these patients end up dying as they fail to raise the required money to get the blood, which is accessed on a cash up-front basis,\u201d said Dr Dari.", "comments": "66", "shares": "9"}

Instead, Mapeza has placed faith in new arrivals \u2014 Albert Eonde of Cameroon and Zambian Shadreck Mayembe to combine with the likes of Soccer Star of the year Rodwell Chinyengetere, Gift Mbweti and Charles Sibanda in fronting the FC Platinum attack.\nThe champions also sealed the deals to bring midfielders Rahman Kutsanzira and Liberty Chakoroma, who have some experience with continental football. Kutsanzira arrives from former champions Highlanders while Chakoroma whose stock has been rising with each season was recruited from Ngezi Platinum.\nGhanaian trialist forward Ibrahim Dauda, did not make the cut amid revelations that Mapeza reckoned that the West African was more an offensive midfielder and not the out and out striker he was looking for.\nSpeedy winger Marshall Mudehwe is also a surprise inclusion on the squad with his registration ending speculation that the former Warriors fringe player was headed for a move to Dynamos to reunite with former coaches Lloyd Mutasa and Biggie Zuze.\nBig defender Lawrence Mhlanga who spent the entire 2017 season sidelined by a contractual dispute with Chicken Inn will now bounce back into action with FC Platinum after he made it on the Champions League squad.\nMhlanga is joined by on-loan right-back Jameson Mukombwe among the new defenders on FC Platinum\u2019s books.\nZIFA had on Saturday also helped Mhlanga\u2019s cause when they ruled that the player was free to join a club of his choice. The other players who were not part of the championship winning side include Kelvin Madzongwe, Never Tigere, Nigel Papias who returned from a loan stint with relegated Bantu Rovers as well as goalkeeper Collin Phiri whose loan spell at another doomed side, Hwange also ended. But contract rebel Ian Nekati who has set his sights on securing a move out of the country has been dropped and if he fails to land a contract in South Africa might have to look for a club elsewhere in the domestic league.\nFC Platinum assistant coach Lizwe Sweswe said they had altered the areas they felt were weak and were also optimistic that their team will reach at least the group stages of Africa\u2019s premier club competition.\n\u201cI think what is important for this competition is to have adequate preparations and we will be working hard to be prepared for the tournament. With what is already at our disposal we have the capacity to reach the group stages and we will continue working hard to achieve that.\n\u201cWe submitted a list of players we wanted to the executive but I have not yet seen the final list submitted to CAF. But in terms of our squad we already had a very good squad which managed to win the championship but they are few areas we feel needed reinforcements for us to be able to play continental football,\u201d Sweswe said.\n\u201cIn modern football when you are talking of a striker you just need someone who can score goals and if we can get good goal scorers we are home and dry. What is important now is for the new arrivals to understand the culture of FC Platinum and adjust to our playing style.\n\u201cIn terms of quality Shadreck and Albert are good and they can come with an important dimension that will complement what we already have and hopefully they together with those players we retained should be able to score more goals for the team,\u201d said Sweswe.\nFC Platinum spokesperson Chido Chizondo said they would add more players to the squad if the need arose. Chiizondo said they had acted on the recommendations of their technical department and were confident they have a good enough side to go beyond the early rounds.\n\u201cWe have sent in 28 players and there is room to add more players since CAF allow up to 30 but for now we will work with that list, special cases will be treated as the situation arises.\n\u201cBasing on the coaches\u2019 recommendations, the players we have retained and the new acquisitions should be in a position to take us through to the group stages. But going to the group stages will not be about individuals but team work at all levels from players, technical department, executive, various stakeholders including sponsors, supporters and the media,\u201d said Chizondo.\nFC Platinum Squad:\nGoalkeepers: Francis Tizayi, Petros Mhari, Wallace Magalane, Collin Phiri\nDefenders: Raphael Muduviwa, Jameson Mukombwe, Elvis Moyo, Kelvin Moyo, William Sitima, Gift Bello, Lawrence Mhlanga\nMidfielders: Winston Mhango, Nqobizitha Masuku, Liberty Chakoroma, Never Tigere, Kelvin Madzongwe, Marshall Mudehwe, Hillary Bakacheza, Rahman Kutsanzira, Rodwell Chinyengetere, Bret Amidu, Ali Sadiki\nStrikers: Mkhokheli Dube, Gift Mbweti, Albert Eonde, Shadreck Mayembe, Nigel Papias, Charles Sibanda\nMore Stories:", "comments": "6", "shares": "2"}

It started in what had become the usual way, continuing indiscipline and modest economic decline with agriculture being the only bright spot and by September panic was creeping into society with the black market exploding and the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange reacting to a widely-held belief that Zimbabwe was about to hit the economic rocks again.\nThen came November. Under the shield of the Defence Forces\u2019 Operation Restore Legacy the people took control of their destiny, Zanu-PF repudiated its leader, Parliament started impeachment proceedings that were going to succeed and so President Mugabe resigned.\nIt is perhaps a good time to reflect that it is only just over six weeks since Zimbabweans of all backgrounds, political and economic, came together to demand change and just over five weeks since President Emmerson Mnangagwa was sworn in as President.\nAnd we have already seen major changes. For a start, the people are not really interested in hearing fancy speeches that have almost zero basis with reality. They want action, they want the worst problems fixed promptly and they want to see Zimbabwe accelerating forward on a road that will lead to respectable rates of economic growth and rising standards of living.\nPresident Mnangagwa can obviously read that mood and in his short, snappy public interventions has made it clear that he wants to be judged on results, and that he sees his Government as a group of practical men and women whose primary purpose is to fix the immediate problems, with all ministries now well into the 100-days he set for the first challenge, and do what they need to do to open and grow the economy for longer term benefits.\nAlready there has been measurable progress. Command Agriculture, a programme close to the President\u2019s heart when he pushed it forward as Vice President, is accelerating with opposition muted. Getting farming fixed is good in the short-term, medium-term and long-term since doing so cuts imports, boosts exports and raises the standard of living of around half the population.\nAnd it looks as though the moderate indiscipline that crept into the first year will be stamped out. By the end of the current season, with a good block of tens of thousands of farmers able to prove they can be trusted to produce and fulfil contracts once given the chance, we can start moving towards more formalised systems tapping private as well as public money.\nCorruption is being hit hard. It is fairly obvious that there is now no protection for the dishonest. A number of cases have started wending their way through the courts and several other people have been quizzed by law enforcement officers. Whatever the results of subsequent trials, the word is getting out that people who can abuse their office had better be able to justify their wealth.\nEven the amnesties for foreign exchange cheating and tax evasion are being followed up practically. The Reserve Bank has already contacted a large group of companies and individuals suggesting that they should really take advantage of the break they have been given.\nIt now appears that the National Budget is being treated as a serious document and blueprint, rather than just a vague wish-list that can be broken at will. The Treasury has already announced it is taking administrative action, even before Parliament has been recalled to debate the larger changes, to tighten spending.\nOne example of the practical \u201cfix-it\u201d approach of the President and new Government is over prices. President Mnangagwa has made it clear he does not want decrees fixing prices, but instead wants the problems identified and fixed. This was seen with bread prices, where there was obvious collusion, but where an immediate investigation found one small problem, the fact that printed plastic bags were not a priority, that could be fixed almost instantly.\nOne interesting vote of confidence that change for the good is likely comes from the black market. The premiums are falling. More formally the stock exchange is seeing investors moving from panic mode, seeking to protect assets in a financial collapse, towards thoughtful estimates of how much shares might be worth in a couple of years with decent economic growth and more factories re-opening or moving towards full production.\nIn many ways Zimbabwe is now rejoining much of Africa where the last two decades have seen good steady growth and leaders seeking election or re-election on the basis of graphs showing rising wealth and rising numbers of jobs.\nThe overwhelming majority of Africans were born or grew up after independence and while they are grateful to forefathers who won independence they are voting for men and women who can help them achieve a decent future.\nPresident Mnangagwa and his Government will be seeking re-election round about the middle of the year. They have obviously decided that the best way to win the votes is to do the same, showing they can fix things and can deliver. That is not a bad test to apply. It is the same one that the rest of us in our ordinary everyday lives have to pass if we want to keep our jobs, keep our businesses viable or, if we are very young, get up the next rung in the education ladder.\nMore Stories:", "comments": "1", "shares": "3"}

North Korea must \"mass-produce nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles and speed up their deployment\", he said.\nHe also said they would not use their weapons unless they felt that peace was threatened.\nWhile his language against the US remained tough, Mr Kim did not employ his typically antagonistic tone when speaking about his neighbours in South Korea.\n\"The year 2018 is a significant year for both the North and the South, with the North marking the 70th anniversary of its birth and the South hosting the Winter Olympics.\nimage copyrightReuters\n\"We should melt the frozen North-South relations, thus adorning this meaningful year as a year to be specially recorded in the history of the nation,\" he said.\nA spokesperson for the South Korean president said their office had \"always stated our willingness to talk with North Korea at anytime and anywhere\".\n\"We hope the two Koreas will sit down and find a solution to lower tensions and establish peace on the Korean peninsula.\"\nYoungshik Daniel Bong, a research fellow at Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies, told the BBC that addressing the South was a marked change from the norm for Mr Kim.\n\"North Korea usually ignores South Korea, maintaining the position that as a 'nuclear power' it will deal with the US on its own,\" said Mr Bong. \"It appears that by engaging the South, he hopes to create an estrangement between South Korea and the US.\"\nThe analyst also said that Mr Kim could be seeking to improve ties to offer some respite from the growing economic pressures from the recent UN sanctions.\nMr Kim also said he would also consider sending a delegation to the Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in February - a gesture which South Korea has previously suggested would be welcome.\n\"North Korea's participation in the Winter Games will be a good opportunity to show unity of the people and we wish the Games will be a success,\" he said.\n\"Officials from the two Koreas may urgently meet to discuss the possibility.\"\nThe president of the PyeongChang Games' organising committee, Lee Hee-beom, told South Korea's news agency Yonhap he was delighted to hear of the potential participation.\n\"[The committee] enthusiastically welcomes it. It's like a New Year's gift,\" he said.\nThe only two North Korean athletes who qualified for the Games are figure skaters Ryom Tae-Ok and Kim Ju-Sik.\nAlthough the North has missed the official deadline to confirm their participation, the skaters could still compete with an invitation by the International Olympic Committee.\nSouth Korea's President Moon Jae-in last month suggested delaying an annual joint military drill with US troops until after the Games. The North usually denounces any such exercises as a rehearsal for war.\nRobert Kelly, a political science professor at South Korea's Pusan National University, told the BBC that the Winter Olympics statement was \"a smart move from North Korea\" as it positioned Mr Kim's regime as moving towards its neighbours while the US was seeking to isolate it.", "comments": "55", "shares": "23"}

This year promises to be pivotal in our quest for CHANGE.\nUnfortunately, I am saddened to acknowledge that for many this Christmas and New Year holidays have been anything but merry and happy. Instead of showing love, companionship and charity, some of our compatriots chose this period to inflict severe hardship on us all by creating unnecessary fuel scarcity across the country.\nThe consequence was that not many could travel and the few who did had to pay exorbitant transport fares. This is unacceptable given that NNPC had taken measures to ensure availability at all depots. I am determined to get to the root of this collective blackmail of all Nigerians and ensure that whichever groups are behind this manipulated hardship will be prevented from doing so again.\nSuch unpatriotism will not divert the Administration from the course we have set ourselves. Our government\u2019s watch word and policy thrust is CHANGE. We must change our way of doing things or we will stagnate and be left behind in the race to lift our people out of poverty and into prosperity.\nMy address to fellow Nigerians this morning is devoted mainly to informing you about the intense efforts this Administration is putting to address our country\u2019s huge infrastructural deficit.\nWe are going to make significant in-roads in advancing road, rail and power projects across the country.\nThe Ministry of Power, Works and Housing is one of the drivers of this Government\u2019s commitment to renew and increase Nigeria\u2019s stock of infrastructure in order to achieve global economic competitiveness as targeted under the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.\nWith regards to Railways, we have set ourselves ambitious targets. Already in construction stage is the Lagos-Kano Standard Gauge Railway.\nThe line should reach Ibadan from Lagos by the end of 2019 and will carry two million passengers per year and five million tons of cargo will be transported every year giving a substantial boost to the country\u2019s economy.\nConstruction of the Kano \u2013 Kaduna segment is expected to commence this year and reach Kaduna by the end of 2019. By the end of 2021 the two ends will be joined so that we will have standard gauge railway across the main North-South trading route.\nThe Abuja \u2013 Kaduna route will be boosted by additional rolling stock next Thursday and will be able to handle one million commuters annually.\nAt the same time I have approved and negotiations will be concluded in the first part of this year for the Port Harcourt to Maiduguri line covering Aba, Owerri, Umuahia, Enugu, Awka, Abakaliki, Makurdi, Lafia, Jos, Bauchi, Gombe, Yola and Damaturu. The Abuja to Itakpe line will go through Baro and terminate in Warri with construction of a new seaport at Warri.\nNegotiations are also advanced for the construction of other railway lines, firstly from Kano to Maradi in Niger Republic passing through Kazaure, Daura, Katsina, Jibia to Maradi.\nSecondly, Lagos to Calabar the \u201cCoastal Rail\u201d through Ore, Benin, Agbor, Asaba, Onitsha, Sapele, Ughelli, Warri, Yenagoa, Otuoke, Port Harcourt, Aba, Uyo and Calabar. In the next few years, all these Nigerian cities will be linked by functional modern rail systems, giving enormous boost to the social and economic life of our people.\nWith respect to the Abuja Capital Light Rail, progress has reached 98% completion, as at 64% completion when we assumed office. Only test runs remain before start of operations.\nThis train service will stimulate economic activities in the Federal Capital and provide residents with an efficient and safe transportation system. Twelve railway sub-stations around the capital over a 45.2 kilometre route will serve as a catalyst and a pull factor to the economy of the area. The Light Rail System will reduce traffic congestion and carbon emission in line with the Administration\u2019s policy on climate change.\nManagement of the Federal Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA) has been reconstituted and has been charged with a 12 week rapid intervention in road repairs to cover all the geo-political zones. Government is undertaking repairs and maintenance of 44 roads within the six geo-political zones.\nTwenty five major highways will be funded under the N100b SUKUK facility. Each geo-political zone will benefit by an equal amount of N16.67b. The following major highways are to receive special attention:\na. Oyo \u2013 Ogbomosho,\nb. Ofusu \u2013 Ore \u2013 Ajebandele \u2013 Shagamu,\nc. Yenagoa Road Junction \u2013 Kolo Otuoke \u2013 Bayelsa Palm,\nd. Enugu \u2013 Port Harcourt Dual Carriage Way,\ne. Onitsha \u2013 Enugu Expressway,\nf. Kaduna Eastern Bypass,\ng. Dualization of Kano \u2013 Maiduguri Road,\nh. Dualization of Abuja \u2013 Lokoja \u2013 Benin Road,\ni. Dualization of Suleja \u2013 Minna Road.\nIn addition, Government has approved work to start on the re-construction of Abuja \u2013 Kaduna \u2013 Zaria \u2013 Kano road which is in a state of disrepair. Work will soon start and is expected to be completed in 2019.\nMore Nigerians across the country are experiencing improved power supply to their homes and businesses. However, power remains a concern to this government because too many people still do not have regular and reliable supply.\nThe Payment Assurance Guarantee Scheme which started in January 2016 has enabled the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trader to raise so far N701 billion to assure Generation Companies of at least 80% payment for any power delivered to the national grid.\nConsequently, generation has now reached 7,000MW. On December 8, 2017 the country achieved 5,155MW of power delivered to consumers, the highest level ever recorded.\nSeveral moribund projects have been revived. Repairs of Afam Power Station added 110MW in 2017 and another 240MW will be added this year through a private investment partnership.\nKatsina Power Project is now being tested and producing 10MW of power from wind for the first time in Nigeria. It should be fully operational this year.\nThe Zungeru 700MW Hydroelectric Power Project, stalled by court cases is due for completion in 2019. The transmission and other requirements to operate the 30MW Gurara Phase 1 Hydroelectric Plant, the 40MW Kashimbilla Hydroelectric Plant and the 215 MW Kaduna Gas/LPG/Diesel Power Plant will also be completed this year.\nA landmark project, Mambilla Hydroelectric Power Project is at last taking off. This project has been on the drawing Board for 40 years, but now the engineering, procurement and construction contract for the 3,050MW project has been agreed with a Chinese joint venture Company with a financing commitment from the government of China. Completion is targeted for 2023.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Transmission Company of Nigeria can now distribute all the 7,000MW that can be generated. TCN and the Niger Delta Holding Company have added 1,950MVA of 330 down to 132KV transformer capacity of 10 transmission stations and 2,930MVA of 132 down to 33KV transformer capacity of 42 sub-stations including Ikot Ekpene, Aba, Alagbon, Ajah, Ejigbo, Funtua and Zaria.\nThis Administration is working with the privatised distribution Companies to overcome the continuing challenges of distribution.\nThese massive public works should spearhead the recovery and lead millions back to employment. You will recall that it was not until last year that we got out of the economic recession into which the country had fallen as a consequence of past unsustainable economic policies which projected short-term illusory growth.\nThe government is slowly stabilizing the economy.\nIt was in order to change the steady and steep decline that we adopted the more sustainable policies and programmes captured in the Economic Recovery Plan. Diversification efforts have resulted in improved output particularly in agriculture and solid minerals sectors. The relative exchange rate stability has improved manufacturing sector performance.\nWe have got to get used to discipline and direction in economic management. The days of business as usual are numbered.\nTwo years ago I appealed to people to go back to the land. I am highly gratified that agriculture has picked up, contributing to the government\u2019s effort to re-structure the economy. Rice imports will stop this year. Local rice, fresher and more nutritious will be on our dishes from now on.\nBy the same token, I am today appealing to enterprising Nigerians with ideas and unemployed graduates and other able-bodied and literate men and women with ideas not to just sit and wait for employment from the government or the Organized Private Sector. Great nations are built by enterprising people who turn their hands to anything that circumstances dictate.\nIn respect of political developments, I have kept a close watch on the on-going debate about \u201cRestructuring\u201d. No human law or edifice is perfect. Whatever structure we develop must periodically be perfected according to changing circumstances and the country\u2019s socio-economic developments. We Nigerians can be very impatient and want to improve our conditions faster than may be possible considering our resources and capabilities. When all the aggregates of nationwide opinions are considered, my firm view is that our problems are more to do with process than structure.\nWe tried the Parliamentary system: we jettisoned it. Now there are shrill cries for a return to the Parliamentary structure. In older democracies these systems took centuries to evolve so we cannot expect a copied system to fit neatly our purposes. We must give a long period of trial and improvement before the system we have adopted is anywhere near fit for purpose.\nHowever, there is a strong case for a closer look at the cost of government and for the public services long used to extravagance, waste and corruption to change for the better. I assure you that government is ever receptive to ideas which will improve governance and contribute to the country\u2019s peace and stability.\nAs the electioneering season approaches politicians must avoid exploiting ethnicity and religion by linking ethnicity with religion and religion with politics. Such must be avoided at all costs if we are to live in harmony.\nIn this respect the rest of Nigeria could learn from the South Western States who have successfully internalized religion, ethnicity and politics.\nPolitical discourse should be conducted with civility, decorum and in a constitutional manner. We all have a collective responsibility to strengthen our democracy and entrench the rule of law. We should draw encouragement from the series of bye-elections conducted by INEC last year which were generally violence free and their outcomes adjudged to be free and fair.\nBefore I conclude my address I must reassure my fellow citizens that security of life and property is still top of our government\u2019s agenda. We have since beaten Boko Haram. Isolated attacks still occur, but even the best-policed countries cannot prevent determined criminals from committing terrible acts of terror as we have seen during the past years in Europe, Asia, Middle East, elsewhere in Africa and in America.\nOur government remains determined to protect all Nigerians in line with our election pledge and promises. On behalf of all Nigerians let me offer our thanks to the Armed forces, the Police, other para-military forces and traditional authorities who are working round the clock to ensure that you and I go about our normal business in reasonable safety.\nTerrorism and urban crimes are world-wide phenomena and our security forces are continuously adapting their responses to changing threats.\nWith regard to rampant cases of kidnappings, we are taking immediate short-term measures to combat this new evil creeping into our societies. Tighter police methods and swift and severe punishment for those proved to be engaged in kidnapping are on the way.\nWith respect to Niger Delta, Government is still engaging responsible leadership of the Communities to help in identifying and addressing genuine grievances of the region. Our clean-up programme in collaboration with the United Nations is making satisfactory progress.\nI am grateful to all the Governors and other Political & Community leaders of the Niger Delta States for their part in bringing relative peace to the areas.\nFinally let me again express my heartfelt thanks to all Nigerians who prayed for me during my illness last year. I feel deeply humbled by your prayers and good wishes and I am more determined than ever to serve you to the best of my ability.\nGood morning. And I wish everyone a Happy New Year.", "comments": "107", "shares": "152"}

But his \u2018thank you tour\u2019 is controversial and causing political tension.\nThe opposition parties are accusing the president of unbridled abuse and misappropriation of state resources and funds, to pay for his nationwide electioneering, costing millions of dollars, to ensure that his ruling party stays in office \u2013 despite growing poverty in the country.\nThough the start of election campaign is yet to be officially announced by the country\u2019s National Electoral Commission, the president is using every opportunity to make full use of his final days in office, by personally taking on the de-facto role of election campaign manager of the ruling party\u2019s presidential and vice-presidential candidates \u2013 Samura Kamara and Chernor Bah.\nDelivering his final New Year\u2019s address to the nation today, president Koroma is fully aware of the political tension that has been created recently, as he ratchets the rhetoric and turns up the heat on the opposition.\nBut few in the opposition parties would appreciate his efforts at ameliorating the damage he may be causing to the country\u2019s democracy, as he addresses them: \u201cto my friends on the other side of the political aisle, to our ever-vibrant media and civil society, you have all played your part in no small measure in the last ten years of my presidency. And for those positive roles you played, I am thankful.\u201d\nAs the president prepares to leave office next year, this \u2013 his final New Year\u2019s address would be remembered, if at all, for its pre-election rallying of the ruling party\u2019s supporters, as few in the country would take the president\u2019s upbeat view of the economy and individual prosperity seriously.\nThis is what president Koroma told the people of Sierra Leone:\nFellow Sierra Leoneans, usually as we shed away the old year, we look forward to the events of the New Year with great hopes, and we make great resolutions in view of our new aspirations. At this moment in particular, our thoughts are focused on March 7th 2018.\nElections everywhere present a great test to a nation\u2019s ability to continue to stay together. While some have passed this test, others have had to resort to unrest that rip them apart. For us in Sierra Leone, we started passing this test when we voted in 1996 against the threat of the barrel of the gun and machetes. We succeeded in restoring democracy.\nSubsequent elections right on to 2012 have been acclaimed by the international community. Steadily, we have secured for ourselves great democratic credentials; and to countries the world over, we are a brilliant example of peace and democracy.\nBut as Sierra Leoneans go to the polls on March 7th to vote for their leaders at ward, parliamentary and presidential levels, our political landscape will once again be redefined. I know that it is common these days to dismiss the importance of politics and political decisions. Yes, it may be typical but unwise. For whether we survive and prosper or decline depends ultimately, on the political decisions we now take.\nMy belief is that however tough they may be, the right decisions, like the de-amalgamation or the toll road, are always beneficial and should be taken irrespective of opposition to them. We must therefore hold firm, in these heightened political times, to the new framework of efficient economic management through which we have been able to attain one of the highest economic growth rates in world.\nWe must be bold on reform, including the tax regimes we have implemented, because already these bold decisions, regardless of the critics, are visibly improving our service delivery of energy, pipe borne water, in schools and in hospitals. We must hold on to university reform, which is strategic to nation building.\nAnd in order to end the \u201claisser-faire\u201d idea of the past, we must further open up our public services to greater diversity, to greater competition and to greater alternatives. For this to happen, we must robustly enforce the changes in our criminal justice system and devise new penalties for abuse of public office just as much as we must do against anti-social behaviour.\nAlongside the huge investment we are making, these are an essential part of creating a society of rights and responsibilities.\nFellow Sierra Leoneans, the past years have trials and triumphs. Our challenges seemed overbearing \u2013 homes were swept off in flash floods; in a merciless mudslide we lost loved ones whom we continue to remember and whose survivors we continue to support.\nThe footprints of Ebola are still visible in our economy, yet as a government and people, we have been able to rise above the tide and made giant strides in putting our bitter experiences behind us.\nAs we look back on the last ten years, and forward to the next, we should be proud of the way we have carried with the management of the state; with the way we have built our democracy; with the way we have consolidated our peace; and with the way have responded to the attacks upon our humanity and our economy.\nSierra Leone can be proud of the gallantry with which we fought Ebola, the steadfastness with which we resisted the impacts of the fall in the commodity prices, and the magnanimity with which we responded to the August 14th Mudslide and Flash floods.\nLet us therefore maintain and build on the gains we have made together by building more roads and bridges to connect more remote communities; by increasing our energy capacity to stimulate manufacturing and mining activities which will create jobs and other economic activities. Pipe borne water in rural communities is improving, but we need to take supply to far-flung areas.\nThis demands for an even more ambitious development agenda to complement the Agenda for Change and the Agenda for Prosperity, because our economic growth, though is the highest since independence, needs more boost.\nAgricultural productivity is at an appreciable rate, but we need to make available more cash transfers to farmers, provide them with further access to finance and farm inputs. Let us move on faster and in an appreciable way towards agro-processing. These are the resolutions we must make to reduce poverty, for our children, for our working families, and for our aged.\nI gave the Anti-Corruption Commission power to prosecute those who take liberties with public funds; let us continue to narrow the space for corruption, but continue to open the space for free speech.\nThe decisions we must take may not be simple; they may not be popular in the short-term. But in the long term, all will help to set our beloved nation on a course of greater prosperity, security and fairness.\nFellow Sierra Leoneans, together we have been able to lay a strong foundation and as I leave, I am confident about a country of fair opportunities, where everyone has the equal chance to develop their potential; and where you get on in life based on hard work, competence, and productivity \u2013 not your ethnicity, your region, or your connections.\nWe can achieve these aspirations faster by further strengthening our governance institutions; by allowing them to function properly; and by enforcing discipline through the fair implementation of the Rule of Law.\nI want to end this New Year\u2019s message by thanking my wife, Sia and daughters \u2013 Dankay and Alice. You have been the foundation and pillars of my presidency. I would not have been able to carry on without your support, your understanding and your unending love.\nTo the thousands of our security men and women and our other compatriots in the public service, who have been away from their families for Christmas and the New Year. They have had to forfeit their holidays and the celebrations we enjoy with our families in the service of our nation.\nOver and over and again, our security forces have earned a reputation for their dedication to service for which we all owe them a huge debt of appreciation.\nMany thanks to all those who have served in my cabinet, past and present, to all those who served in parliament and in the councils. To my staffers in the Office of the President at State House and elsewhere, you deserve special thanks because throughout my tenure, in good and bad times, you are the unseen hands and brains behind the implementation of my policies and in the day \u2013 to \u2013 day execution of my mandate.\nTo my brothers, my sisters, my dear aunts; and to all members of my extended family and my friends \u2013 your support has been substantial and enduring.\nTo the greatest party in our country\u2019s history \u2013 the All People\u2019s Congress \u2013 its National Officers and more importantly, its members and grass root supporters, I cannot thank you enough for trusting in me twice with the leadership of our party; you are the main reason I became President and to you I am deeply indebted.\nAnd to all Sierra Leoneans, the students and pupils, the ordinary man and woman on the farms, in the market places, in the Lorry Parks, at the Motor Bike points, the technicians of various trades; and to my friends on the other side of the political aisle, to our ever vibrant media and civil society \u2013 you have all played your part in no small measure in the last ten years of my presidency. And for those positive roles you played, I am thankful.\nOnce again, as we bid 2017 farewell, we must resolve never to reverse the progress we have made so painstakingly together; we must remember that Sierra Leone\u2019s best days are ahead; that we are on course to attain middle income status within the projected period.\nIt is therefore our duty to preserve our reputation and maintain our development strides, bearing in mind that Sierra Leone is easier to be run as a unified nation.\nIt is understandable that campaigns may be tense, passions may run high. But let us maintain those attributes that are in keeping with the rule of law. Let us go into these elections and come out a stronger, more peaceful and more unified nation. Because in the end, we have only one Sierra Leone.\nHappy New Year, God Bless you, and God Bless the Republic of Sierra Leone.\u201d\nRelated", "comments": "0", "shares": "7"}

It was signed by Museveni on December 27 but not publicly acknowledged until now.\n\u201cThe president assented to the bill and it is now law,\u201d said press secretary Don Wanyama.\n\u201cThe previous law was discriminatory in nature but this has been dealt with for the good of Ugandans.\u201d\nThe amendment reimposes a two-term limit on the presidency scrapped by ruling party MPs in 2005 allowing Museveni, in power since 1986, to run for a third, fourth and fifth term in elections widely criticised as being unfair.\nWanyama dismissed the notion that the law was tailored to allow Museveni\u2019s sixth term as \u201cspeculative\u201d.\nBut veteran opposition leader Kizza Besigye described the law change as part of \u201ca well-orchestrated plan to have Museveni rule for life\u201d.\nMuseveni hails 317 MPs\nIn his new year address on Sunday, President Yoweri Museveni saluted the Members of Parliament (MPs) that supported the \u2018Age Limit\u2019 Bill.\n\u201cI want to salute the 317 MPs who defied intimidation, malignment and blackmail and opted for a flexible constitution to deal with the destiny issues of Africa instead of maintaining Uganda on the path of unimaginative, non-ideological, neo-colonial status quo ,\u201d he said as he concluded his new year address on Sunday that covered issues related to security, economy, integration, Africa and the Congo.\n\u201cBy so doing, they enabled us to avoid the more complicated paths that would have been required,\u201d he added.\nThe Constitution Amendment Bill 2017 was in the week before Christmas passed with the requried two-thirds majority. The vote result was 317 yes, 97 no.\nThe MPs passed the tenure of parliament to be extended from five to seven years. The MPs approved a 7-year term for Parliament and local governments positions starting with ongoing term.\nThis was quickly followed by approval of article 102 (b), lifting the age limit of 75 for one to contest for presidency.\nFinally the House reinstated the presidential terms in the constitution by passing clause 105 of the Bill. The clause states that, \u201cA person shall not hold office as President for more than two terms.\u201d\nWhat next?\nIn a letter to the Clerk to Parliament, the President signified his assent to the Bill on Wednesday, 27 December 2017.\nThe Act prescribes 18 years as the age for prospective presidential candidates, from the 35 previously prescribed by the old legal regime.\nThe upper age limit for presidential candidates has also been removed, together with that of Local Councils Chairpersons. Equally, Parliament\u2019s term has been extended from five to seven years, beginning with the 10th Parliament.\nLocal Councils\u2019 terms are also extended from five to seven years, beginning with the current tenure.\nGeneral elections for Local Councils and Parliament will now be held in 2023, from the 2021 envisaged in the pre-existing legal order.\nAccording to section 13(1) of the Acts of Parliament Act, \u201cevery Act shall be published by the government printer as soon as possible after the president\u2019s assent has been signified\u2026\u201d\nReport on the Uganda Constitution Amendment(No.2) Bill, 2017 by The Independent Magazine on Scribd", "comments": "0", "shares": "0"}

After much personal and financial wrangling, Chelsea and Atl\u00e9tico struck a deal to return Costa to sender in late September. Costa\u2019s Chelsea career was effectively ended with Conte\u2019s now-famous \u201cthanks for the seasono\u201d text message after the FA Cup final loss, though Costa\u2019s fate had been sealed many months prior already.\nCosta, who was well-liked in the dressing room and (usually) by the fans as well, struck a diplomatic tone when asked about his time in London at his \u201cunveiling\u201d.\n\u201cSeriously, the supporters, the people at the club and my teammates helped me a lot. Chelsea is a great club and I only have good memories.\u201d\nCosta joked about \u201clearning English\u201d at Chelsea, while also talking about the frustrations of having to watch from the sidelines while Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s FIFA transfer ban slowly expired. But now he\u2019s ready to make his impact felt, as Atl\u00e9ti look to finish a solid second in the league (behind runaway leaders Barcelona) and maybe make the most of dropping out the Champions League by winning the Europa League (they face FC Copenhagen in the round of 32). Costa will also look to challenge his Chelsea replacement for the Spain center forward job for next summer\u2019s World Cup.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this moment for a long time. I just want to get in shape to play as soon as possible, I\u2019m tired of training. You can tell I\u2019ve already worked and prepared well to play, I\u2019m here to help the team and score goals.\n\u201cAtleti are not in the Champions League now, but we are going to fight for what we have left. I need to play. As a bystander, I suffered more than as a player.\u201d\nweaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com", "comments": "0", "shares": "0"}

The youngest one is 19 years old, that we have recorded so far, and the oldest is 93, so it\u2019s a wide spectrum.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say with binary options coming into play the average victim\u2019s age of investment fraud has dropped because previously it was over 60 and now it\u2019s early 50s.\n\u201cIt\u2019s because the younger generation are taking part in this activity, and it could be easily explained as social media is a lot to do with it, the advertisements and the pop ups etc.\u201d\nBinary options trading is currently regulated by the Gambling Commission but from January 2018 the Financial Conduct Authority will take over.\nIn other countries however, such as Israel and Canada, it has been banned completely.\nFrank Thornburrow, from Kent, lost his life savings when he invested in binary options. He has been unable to get any money back and told Sky News that he believes he was conned.\nHe gives one example from an email telling him that to access his money he would have to make 150,000 trades, which was money he simply did not have.\n\u201cThe last couple of years haven\u2019t been easy,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI lost my daughter couple of years ago when she died of cancer. I retired and I was looking for a way of making money so I tried binary because it looked good.\n\u201cAnd basically it was a big con, it didn\u2019t work out and I lost a lot of money. I\u2019ve ended up with a triple bypass, so that\u2019s the impact it\u2019s had on me.\u201d\nThere is also concern that students are falling victims to scam companies after gambling with their maintenance grants to \u201cflip\u201d their money, according to Action Fraud.\nThe advice from police is that \u201cif you don\u2019t know the field, don\u2019t get involved in it\u201d as there are \u201cso many rogue companies out there\u201d.\nWhich? carried out its own investigations into binary options companies and found evidence of \u201cbad practice across the board\u201d, with high pressure sales tactics and \u201cunfair\u201d terms and conditions.\nJenni Allen, managing director at Which? Money, said: \u201cWe found for instance that people making a deposit had to invest up to forty times that deposit to even access their money again.\n\u201cI think most worryingly we also found examples of where the actual data being used was rigged by the company so that your initial investments would return some form of profit in return but thereafter you would receive loss after loss.\u201d \u2013news.sky.com", "comments": "1", "shares": "0"}

And out of the ashes should emerge a well-oiled machine that will steer Harare back to the 21st century. Out of the ashes should emerge rays unbroken by the dark cloud that has been hovering over the Sunshine City.\nEverything is broken at Town House and the only way forward is to destroy in order to rebuild.\nWater is not coming out of taps and when it does, it is not safe to drink. It is always lights out on the potholed streets on which rain water stands still due to clogged storm- water drains. Rubbish collects, but is not collected while grass is only trimmed by the elements of the weather.\nClearly, the recent firing of directors is not enough. Everyone should go. Harare should be rebuilt from the ashes of its horrendous past.\nThe fired executives continued to earn between $12 000 and $21 000 from October 2014 to June 2015 in direct violation of a Government directive that the highest earner should take home $10 450.\nAnd as if that were not enough, as we report elsewhere in this issue, the entire workforce at the municipality is overpaid. For example, a council nursing sister pockets $1 527 while a Government nurse has to make do with $500. That means the council nurse who refers all complicated cases to the Government nurse earns three times more. This is ludicrous!\nIt\u2019s no wonder council collects $13 million a month only to blow $10 million on salaries.\nWe urge the Minister of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing, Cde July Moyo, to lead the process of reclaiming the capital\u2019s long-lost glory by employing new brooms.\nThe country\u2019s capital city cannot continue to run on autopilot. We urge Minister Moyo to treat the engagement of a substantive chief executive officer (town clerk) for Harare as a matter of urgency.\nA competent individual with a clear track record in management is needed to set up a lean mean machine that will lead a motivated workforce, which will regain public confidence.\nIn May last year we reported that Government had introduced a performance management system for urban local authorities, which requires every employee to have an approved workplan which is in line with the council budget.\nThe system, which was designed as part of Government measures to enhance service delivery to ratepayers and citizens, would result in the establishment of appraisal panels for each council comprising an official from the Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Ministry, a local Public Service Commission inspector and a town clerk or secretary.\nWhat happened to this plan? What is the performance of Harare City Council?\nSpeaking at the City\u2019s Second Hundred Days Rapid Results Initiative End of Term Review Workshop last year, Deputy Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet Dr Ray Ndhlukula said: \u201cGovernment is committed to continuously reform all public sector institutions in order to realise their purpose in life, that is, to offer high quality services in a reputable, accountable, effective and efficient manner in order to meet the contemporary needs of the citizenry.\u201d\nGovernment must be true to its word and reform Harare City Council. After having pioneered the implementation of the Rapid Results Approach for local authorities, Harare is still the worst run city in the country.\nThe people running the affairs of Harare have proved beyond doubt that they are out of their depth. New faces whose performance will be assessed by Government are needed today.\nAction and not rhetoric should be the new motto.", "comments": "14", "shares": "0"}

This is the final phase of the 2016-2018 Electoral cycle comprising Presidential, National Assembly and Council Elections.\nThe Central Committee took note of the announcement of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) informing the public that nomination for council elections will commence on 13th March 2018 and come to an end on 17th March 2018.\nIt also acknowledged the concern that PDOIS is yet to make a statement on the Council Elections while other political parties have started to campaign on their own individual party tickets.\nTo address the urgencies of the Council Elections and remedy the uncertainty engendered by silence the Central Committee resolved that those interested in contesting in council elections at all levels under a PDOIS ticket should apply for candidature by sending their application letters to their respective ward , regional or municipal committees which should be copied to the Central Committee for notification. Should there be more than one applicant for any single seat, the contestants will be required to discuss to build consensus on how to select one among their number or hold a primary for one candidate to be selected as required by the PDOIS party Constitution, rules and procedures.\nThe Central Committee acknowledges that the party has played a pioneering and prominent role in promoting the candidature of an independent Presidential candidate and would have preferred a transitional non-partisan membership at the National Assembly and council levels, so as to give Gambia a new start , characterised by the smooth levelling of the political field to ensure a free and fair multi party contest in the next electoral cycle. Needless to say, some party leaders have argued that after the presidential elections electoral contest should be on partisan basis to prevent their political parties from dying.\nDespite the fact that the status quo is the promotion of elections on a partisan basis the Central Committee is of the view that the multi partisan or multi sectorial primaries which took place during the convention to select a Presidential Candidate and in Banjul during the National assembly elections to select a National Assembly Candidate is good practice in a period of transitional politics. It has proven to be a means of promoting people centred selection of candidates under a transitional nonpartisan administration rather than a one party centred selection of candidates.\nHence the Central Committee would want all those who are to contest under PDOIS ticket to be ready to participate in primary involving independent and party candidates in order to come up with a consensus candidate who could unify residents of Municipalities, Regions and Wards in promotion of the principle of one Gambia, one Nation, and one People. They should be ready stand against any candidate who wishes to promote the interest of an individual party alone or a personality.\nTHE END\nHalifa Sallah\nFor: Central Committee", "comments": "0", "shares": "3"}

Foday NM Drammeh, member for Tumana constituency has said the work of the personnel of The Gambia Fire and Rescue Services is risky and that fire fighters are paid mediocre salaries.\nHe called on the relevant authorities to look into the matter and improve the salaries and working conditions of the country\u2019s firefighters. He made these assertions during Friday\u2019s adjournment debate at the Legislative House in Banjul.\nHe said these are the people who rescue people from well, toilets and at sea. He added that they use risky boats to rescue people at sea and they are sometimes trapped in fire and burnt to death.\n\u201cTheir lives are not safe much more to save someone\u2019s life and the job they are doing is risky, but looking at their salaries, they are very small with no motivation, despite rendering live saving services to the Gambian populace and are not entitled to risk allowances\u201d, he stressed.\nHe emphasized that the fire fighters have low salaries with no promotion for a period of ten years unlike the Police Force or Army where a personnel is promoted to several ranks within the same period.\n\u201cI think the Interior Minister should look into the issues of the Gambia Fire and Rescue Services\u201d, he said\nOn the issue of Child\u2019s right, Hon. Drammeh averred that children are part and parcel of the country and the youth population of the country\u2019s population comprises of 60 -65% of the population of which these children are part of and that section 29 3 of the constitution, talks about how juvenile offenders should be treated. He said if one goes to the police stations, one would not find any confinement where these children should be kept when they are placed under lawful custody. He urged the Interior Minister to look into the matter and build new prison for the children, adding that they cannot share the same confinement with adults and are vulnerable to anything.\nOn forestry, he said when one talks about the forest, adding that the cutting down of trees, leads to desertification, but there are lot of forest destructive activities, among them is frequent occurrence of bush fires, which he said if not controlled can lead to lack of food for animals such as cattle, particularly in the dry season.\n\u201cThe drivers of the country\u2019s economy are agriculture and that bush fire affects agriculture because it leads to soil erosion, leaching of soil nutrients. Are we are aware that a lot of our wild animals are leaving this country for Senegal, because of frequent outbreak of bush fires in this country?\u201d he said.\nGiving statistics of bush fire occurrences in Tuamana and Kantora, he said from 2013 -2014, 550 hectares have been destroyed by bush fire; that 2014-2015, 1560 hectares have been destroyed; and in 2015 -2016, it has reduced to 335 hectares, which was due to the sensitization tour they embarked on with the regional authorities; that from 2016-2017 the menace increased from 335 hectares to 3998 hectares been destroyed, as no sensitization was conducted.\n\u201cI think it is high time your Ministry of Agriculture look into these issues, because agriculture is inseparable from forest, livestock to be able to diversify agriculture from crop production to livestock production. So if our forests are burnt every year, then there is no reason of diversification, because in URR good number of cattle are dying during the dry season, due mainly to lack of food as a result of bush fires\u201d, he hammered home.\nWhile commending one Haji Baniko Sisohoko for the humanitarian gesture he offered in pumping in 5 to 6 million dalasi in complementing government\u2019s effort to provide health care services of the populace, he implored on the Health Ministry to follow suit to cater for the health needs of his constituency which has a population of 30,000-40,000 people and provide them with health centers.

Jallow, has extolled Members of the National Assembly for the maturity they have demonstrated during proceedings at the adjournment debate of the National Assembly.\n\u201cThe quality of the discussion and the understanding of the issues makes me proud to say that we have a parliament that has lived up to expectations\u201d, he said.\nMr. Jallow said during the first republic, Ministers except that of the Justice Ministry were parliamentarians and that was why all of them had to come to the national assembly to attend sittings; that this is not the issue now. He assured members of their presence during sittings of the National Assembly whenever the need arises; that Government cannot operate any function without Legislators.\nOn tractors, Mr. Jallow cited that the millions of dollars that were in the name of The Gambia on loans and grants and the millions taken by the KMC to buy tractors, were used to serve individual interests; that the most important thing is they were taken in the name of the Gambian taxpayer, who are paying the loans used to buy these tractors; that it is therefore necessary for the new Government to investigate and ensure that the tractors are used in the interest of the Gambian people.\nHe said the fertilizer arrived late last year due to the political impasse, but assured Legislatures that negotiations are ongoing and henceforth, fertilizer and seeds will be distributed in a minimum of 30 days before the coming of the first rains; that the long dry spell has affected crops such as groundnut, coos and millet, but that notwithstanding this some areas have excelled in groundnut production and at present they have bought many tons of groundnut, as opposed to the last three years. \u201cThe National Research Institute (NARI) and the seed secretariat have been charged to look into both short duration and more productive oriented seeds that will go with the production level that we envisaged for The Gambia\u201d, he said\nOn road accessibility to rice fields and the transportation of products to the markets, he said they are rehabilitating many rice fields and roads to solve the problem of road accessibility; that efforts are underway in making sure the cooperative union and the cooperative departments are established.\nHe further said that they are trying to modernized, diversify and transform agriculture to be able to process and add value to the products in order to create job opportunities for the young people; that this is very important. He revealed his ministry\u2019s plan of going into livestock, poultry and horticultural production to produce, especially horticultural in the country instead of importing and to export them. He urged the MPs not to leave things with them (Ministers); that they have the direct link with the farmers who they are representing; that they (ministers) are appointed by the head of state, while MPs are appointed by the people and their interests can be connected between the Executive and the people on the ground.\nOn the issue of Ousman Jammeh and Co., he said they should have consulted him even though although he is not the appointing authority; that this was why he told them to write back to these agencies and admit their mistakes, without which he cannot accommodate them.\nHe thanked the MPs and apologized on behalf of his fellow Ministers who spoke in the National Assembly on Thursday 28thDecember, and their statements did not go well with the Legislators; that the NA is their biggest and most important partner; that the president and the ministers are appointed by law and the laws are made by them; that the Ministry of Justice use those laws to carry out its functions.\n\u201cIf anybody amongst us does not have respect for the Legislature, then you don\u2019t have respect for The Gambia as a nation.

Mr Tambadou made this remark during the adjournment debate of Friday 29th December 2017, at the National Assembly.\n\u201cWe should look at the laws establishing the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) to ensure that their responsibility properly reflects the intelligence outfit. So we are in the process of reviewing that law in consultation with the National Intelligence Agency\u201d, he said. He further said they have had the first draft based on consultation with organizations outside the country and shared their suggestions with them; that they are now looking at those suggestions and comments, to make sure that the name is not only changed but their functions and responsibilities too.\nOn the sale of cattle, he said Section 202 of the Constitution empowers the Commission of Enquiry, established by the president under Section 200, to issue interim orders which should not be arbitrary, but based on necessity among other things; that the decisions of the Commission that the Department of Livestock does not have the capacity to handle the number of cattle and the great risk of the cattle are dissipated as some are being unlawful slaughtered for food, stolen or dying, which if not handled will lead to a loss for both state and ex-president. \u201cBecause if the Commission comes back with recommendations that they rightfully belongs to him, they will or should be returned to him (former president), but if they die or dissipate, then of course he also loses when the decision is made\u201d, he explained.\nHe averred that when he received the letter from the Commission for the sale of the cattle, he engaged with the counsel to the Commission on the issue; that after their discussions, they agreed that while the Commission can exercise its jurisdiction to make interim orders in the abundance of caution, it may be better to approach the high court, which had given the original order of placing the cattle in the custody of the Department of Livestock.\n\u201cThis does not mean that the Commission does not have the power. In the abundance of caution we thought it may be better to approach the High Court and as a result of this, the sale of the cattle that was planned on Sunday will be suspended, to approach the High Court which gave the legal custody to the Department of Livestock to allow the sale of the cattle on the same reason and basis, that the Commission has taken in their decision\u201d, he pointed out.\nOn the issue of the Public Order Act, Mr. Tambadou informed the Assembly that in light of the Supreme Court judgment on the Public Order Act, they are on the stage of reviewing the Act; that it is very difficult to balance Acts when dealing with fundamental Human Rights with limitations; that this requires the need to ensure enjoyment of rights and other public interest and matters that need to be taken into considerations.\n\u201cOur thinking at this point is to tilt the balance in favor of the enjoyment of these rights. How far we are going to do that will depend on the review we are conducting, but that is a matter we are considering at the moment \u201c, he concluded.", "comments": "0", "shares": "2"}

Hon. Jatta made this statement during the adjournment debate of Friday 29th December 2017. He said every member in the National Assembly understands the fundamental problems which the country is confronted with; that the essence of Ministers\u2019 presence during sittings of the National Assembly is precisely to hear the problems confronting the country through their representatives; but that the approaches of two of the Ministers who spoke on Thursday, left much to be desired; that their deliberations as Ministers should neither be defensive nor propagandist; but that hearing some of them speak, one tend to think that they are on a political platform and engage in propaganda.\nHon. Jatta said they know what they are talking about and they know the President; that they know who he is and how he is; that Ministers should not come to the assembly, to tell them about the President, but instead for them to look at the issues of the country and how best to solve them. \u2018\u2018That is your essence of being here. The information we have is a tool that you can use in many ways to solve the problems that are being confronted with this country\u201d, Hon. Jatta said. He further said that they are not telling anyone to provide answers to the questions, but that the NA in collaboration with the Ministers, should look at those problems and see how best they can be solved; that among them is poverty; that for 50 years, interventions have been made into poverty alleviation, but paradoxically it keeps on increasing.\n\u201cSo there is a problem somewhere. Why can\u2019t we sit down and question the different methods that have been used to alleviate poverty and they have not succeeded? What is the problem?\u2019\u2019 he remarked.\nHon. Jatta said when Members talk about poverty, they know what they are talking about and they can propose solutions; that the combination of the perspectives of Members and the Ministers, can help solve the problem of the country; that this is their essence of being together.\n\u201cI was not going to speak today if you have not come. That was my position. Because for me engagement with the National assembly takes precedence over all engagements. That is the position in PAC and PEC Committees, because we cannot deal with these problems without you and you cannot deal with the problems of the country without us. We must work together to solve these problems. That is the essence of it\u201d, he pointed out.\nHe emphasized that interventions have been made into these problems for five decades, but we continue to have the same end results; that if the approach given in section 217 3(c) of the Constitution was applied since 1965, a balanced development of all parts of The Gambia, improvement in the quality of life of the rural communities and redressing economic imbalances between rural and urban communities, should have been realized by now; that there are two types of migrations in The Gambia namely Internal and external migrations and that the causes are similar.\n\u201cThere is internal migration because all the opportunities are concentrated in the urban areas. So everybody comes to the urban areas to look for those opportunities. But we know that we can change that situation even overnight, because in the provinces people are producing almost everything. Why not create the facilities of transforming what is being produced there into something else, to create jobs and means of generating revenue, because if you create groundnut processing plants anywhere in the provinces, you are creating jobs there,\u201d he stressed.\nHe said last year almost nothing was exported in terms of groundnut and it is the mainstay of the economy. He urged that efforts should be made to ensure groundnut is utilized in the country and not exported, adding the country will be left with nothing to hang on and unless they address the problem from that point, poverty will never be alleviated; that it is not by putting in grants into things to eradicate poverty.\n\u201cYou must give the poor person the means to do away with his or her poverty. Give farmers the means to do away with their poverty\u201d, he explained.\nHon. Jatta said this can be done if groundnut production is not made a liability, but a means of going forward and living better; that thus one must create the means for the farmers to be able to market and transform their produce into something else and not to market it raw.\n\u201cSo when you say it is not who is criticizing who, they spoke as if you are criticizing them. We are not criticizing you. We know what you are criticizing is the same thing we are criticizing and having done this, we must think of how we must transform that criticism into a tool to transform negative into positive. That is the essence\u201d, he said\nHe said what the Constitution says has never been given any serious consideration; that he believes the Agriculture Minister thinks the same way as he disclosed his ambitions to revitalize the mixed farming centers which were key to the little progress that was made then and it is fundamental, adding that the Minister cannot do without that. He said the country must now think about new seeds and go for early maturing crops, because the rainfall pattern has changed and will keep on changing; that this is what they are talking about. He further said section 215 4 (a) and (b) talks about giving adequate priority in those sectors of the economy that can promote national prosperity; that the number one priority sector is agriculture which he said is vast and called for farmers to be paid in cash instead of promissory notes.\nHon. Jatta said there are sectors of the economy which are not given the due considerations and among them, is mining taking place in kombo and the one that was taking place in Tumana. \u201cDo we know anything about this and when the new government took over, did it make efforts to find out what was happening there? For four to five years and it was closed to the population, but nobody knows what was going on there?\u2019\u2019 he asked.\nHon. Jatta asserted that the country should know what was being produced there; that if anything was coming from there, it should appear in the country\u2019s estimates. \u201cThese are the things that we must know and utilize to help us move forward. That there is something in this country. Mining or not, we can develop and we can move forward with agriculture. We can transform this country into heaven on earth. But it is just a question of what method and sacrifice\u201d, he disclosed\nHe clarified that grants and loans do not help and emphasized that the Chinese owed nobody anything, but capitalist countries owe them trillions.", "comments": "0", "shares": "4"}

This year promises to be pivotal in our quest for CHANGE.\nUnfortunately, I am saddened to acknowledge that for many this Christmas and New Year holidays have been anything but merry and happy. Instead of showing love, companionship and charity, some of our compatriots chose this period to inflict severe hardship on us all by creating unnecessary fuel scarcity across the country.\nThe consequence was that not many could travel and the few who did had to pay exorbitant transport fares. This is unacceptable given that NNPC had taken measures to ensure availability at all depots. I am determined to get to the root of this collective blackmail of all Nigerians and ensure that whichever groups are behind this manipulated hardship will be prevented from doing so again.\nSuch unpatriotism will not divert the Administration from the course we have set ourselves. Our government\u2019s watch word and policy thrust is CHANGE. We must change our way of doing things or we will stagnate and be left behind in the race to lift our people out of poverty and into prosperity.\nMy address to fellow Nigerians this morning is devoted mainly to informing you about the intense efforts this Administration is putting to address our country\u2019s huge infrastructural deficit.\nWe are going to make significant in-roads in advancing road, rail and power projects across the country.\nThe Ministry of Power, Works and Housing is one of the drivers of this Government\u2019s commitment to renew and increase Nigeria\u2019s stock of infrastructure in order to achieve global economic competitiveness as targeted under the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.\nWith regards to Railways, we have set ourselves ambitious targets. Already in construction stage is the Lagos-Kano Standard Gauge Railway.\nThe line should reach Ibadan from Lagos by the end of 2019 and will carry two million passengers per year and five million tons of cargo will be transported every year giving a substantial boost to the country\u2019s economy.\nConstruction of the Kano \u2013 Kaduna segment is expected to commence this year and reach Kaduna by the end of 2019. By the end of 2021 the two ends will be joined so that we will have standard gauge railway across the main North-South trading route.\nThe Abuja \u2013 Kaduna route will be boosted by additional rolling stock next Thursday and will be able to handle one million commuters annually.\nAt the same time I have approved and negotiations will be concluded in the first part of this year for the Port Harcourt to Maiduguri line covering Aba, Owerri, Umuahia, Enugu, Awka, Abakaliki, Makurdi, Lafia, Jos, Bauchi, Gombe, Yola and Damaturu. The Abuja to Itakpe line will go through Baro and terminate in Warri with construction of a new seaport at Warri.\nNegotiations are also advanced for the construction of other railway lines, firstly from Kano to Maradi in Niger Republic passing through Kazaure, Daura, Katsina, Jibia to Maradi.\nSecondly, Lagos to Calabar the \u201cCoastal Rail\u201d through Ore, Benin, Agbor, Asaba, Onitsha, Sapele, Ughelli, Warri, Yenagoa, Otuoke, Port Harcourt, Aba, Uyo and Calabar. In the next few years, all these Nigerian cities will be linked by functional modern rail systems, giving enormous boost to the social and economic life of our people.\nWith respect to the Abuja Capital Light Rail, progress has reached 98% completion, as at 64% completion when we assumed office. Only test runs remain before start of operations.\nThis train service will stimulate economic activities in the Federal Capital and provide residents with an efficient and safe transportation system. Twelve railway sub-stations around the capital over a 45.2 kilometre route will serve as a catalyst and a pull factor to the economy of the area. The Light Rail System will reduce traffic congestion and carbon emission in line with the Administration\u2019s policy on climate change.\nManagement of the Federal Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA) has been reconstituted and has been charged with a 12 week rapid intervention in road repairs to cover all the geo-political zones. Government is undertaking repairs and maintenance of 44 roads within the six geo-political zones.\nTwenty five major highways will be funded under the N100b SUKUK facility. Each geo-political zone will benefit by an equal amount of N16.67b. The following major highways are to receive special attention:\na. Oyo \u2013 Ogbomosho,\nb. Ofusu \u2013 Ore \u2013 Ajebandele \u2013 Shagamu,\nc. Yenagoa Road Junction \u2013 Kolo Otuoke \u2013 Bayelsa Palm,\nd. Enugu \u2013 Port Harcourt Dual Carriage Way,\ne. Onitsha \u2013 Enugu Expressway,\nf. Kaduna Eastern Bypass,\ng. Dualization of Kano \u2013 Maiduguri Road,\nh. Dualization of Abuja \u2013 Lokoja \u2013 Benin Road,\ni. Dualization of Suleja \u2013 Minna Road.\nIn addition, Government has approved work to start on the re-construction of Abuja \u2013 Kaduna \u2013 Zaria \u2013 Kano road which is in a state of disrepair. Work will soon start and is expected to be completed in 2019.\nMore Nigerians across the country are experiencing improved power supply to their homes and businesses. However, power remains a concern to this government because too many people still do not have regular and reliable supply.\nThe Payment Assurance Guarantee Scheme which started in January 2016 has enabled the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trader to raise so far N701 billion to assure Generation Companies of at least 80% payment for any power delivered to the national grid.\nConsequently, generation has now reached 7,000MW. On December 8, 2017 the country achieved 5,155MW of power delivered to consumers, the highest level ever recorded.\nSeveral moribund projects have been revived. Repairs of Afam Power Station added 110MW in 2017 and another 240MW will be added this year through a private investment partnership.\nKatsina Power Project is now being tested and producing 10MW of power from wind for the first time in Nigeria. It should be fully operational this year.\nThe Zungeru 700MW Hydroelectric Power Project, stalled by court cases is due for completion in 2019. The transmission and other requirements to operate the 30MW Gurara Phase 1 Hydroelectric Plant, the 40MW Kashimbilla Hydroelectric Plant and the 215 MW Kaduna Gas/LPG/Diesel Power Plant will also be completed this year.\nA landmark project, Mambilla Hydroelectric Power Project is at last taking off. This project has been on the drawing Board for 40 years, but now the engineering, procurement and construction contract for the 3,050MW project has been agreed with a Chinese joint venture Company with a financing commitment from the government of China. Completion is targeted for 2023.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Transmission Company of Nigeria can now distribute all the 7,000MW that can be generated. TCN and the Niger Delta Holding Company have added 1,950MVA of 330 down to 132KV transformer capacity of 10 transmission stations and 2,930MVA of 132 down to 33KV transformer capacity of 42 sub-stations including Ikot Ekpene, Aba, Alagbon, Ajah, Ejigbo, Funtua and Zaria.\nThis Administration is working with the privatised distribution Companies to overcome the continuing challenges of distribution.\nThese massive public works should spearhead the recovery and lead millions back to employment. You will recall that it was not until last year that we got out of the economic recession into which the country had fallen as a consequence of past unsustainable economic policies which projected short-term illusory growth.\nThe government is slowly stabilizing the economy.\nIt was in order to change the steady and steep decline that we adopted the more sustainable policies and programmes captured in the Economic Recovery Plan. Diversification efforts have resulted in improved output particularly in agriculture and solid minerals sectors. The relative exchange rate stability has improved manufacturing sector performance.\nWe have got to get used to discipline and direction in economic management. The days of business as usual are numbered.\nTwo years ago I appealed to people to go back to the land. I am highly gratified that agriculture has picked up, contributing to the government\u2019s effort to re-structure the economy. Rice imports will stop this year. Local rice, fresher and more nutritious will be on our dishes from now on.\nBy the same token, I am today appealing to enterprising Nigerians with ideas and unemployed graduates and other able-bodied and literate men and women with ideas not to just sit and wait for employment from the government or the Organized Private Sector. Great nations are built by enterprising people who turn their hands to anything that circumstances dictate.\nIn respect of political developments, I have kept a close watch on the on-going debate about \u201cRestructuring\u201d. No human law or edifice is perfect. Whatever structure we develop must periodically be perfected according to changing circumstances and the country\u2019s socio-economic developments. We Nigerians can be very impatient and want to improve our conditions faster than may be possible considering our resources and capabilities. When all the aggregates of nationwide opinions are considered, my firm view is that our problems are more to do with process than structure.\nWe tried the Parliamentary system: we jettisoned it. Now there are shrill cries for a return to the Parliamentary structure. In older democracies these systems took centuries to evolve so we cannot expect a copied system to fit neatly our purposes. We must give a long period of trial and improvement before the system we have adopted is anywhere near fit for purpose.\nHowever, there is a strong case for a closer look at the cost of government and for the public services long used to extravagance, waste and corruption to change for the better. I assure you that government is ever receptive to ideas which will improve governance and contribute to the country\u2019s peace and stability.\nAs the electioneering season approaches politicians must avoid exploiting ethnicity and religion by linking ethnicity with religion and religion with politics. Such must be avoided at all costs if we are to live in harmony.\nIn this respect the rest of Nigeria could learn from the South Western States who have successfully internalized religion, ethnicity and politics.\nPolitical discourse should be conducted with civility, decorum and in a constitutional manner. We all have a collective responsibility to strengthen our democracy and entrench the rule of law. We should draw encouragement from the series of bye-elections conducted by INEC last year which were generally violence free and their outcomes adjudged to be free and fair.\nBefore I conclude my address I must reassure my fellow citizens that security of life and property is still top of our government\u2019s agenda. We have since beaten Boko Haram. Isolated attacks still occur, but even the best-policed countries cannot prevent determined criminals from committing terrible acts of terror as we have seen during the past years in Europe, Asia, Middle East, elsewhere in Africa and in America.\nOur government remains determined to protect all Nigerians in line with our election pledge and promises. On behalf of all Nigerians let me offer our thanks to the Armed forces, the Police, other para-military forces and traditional authorities who are working round the clock to ensure that you and I go about our normal business in reasonable safety.\nTerrorism and urban crimes are world-wide phenomena and our security forces are continuously adapting their responses to changing threats.\nWith regard to rampant cases of kidnappings, we are taking immediate short-term measures to combat this new evil creeping into our societies. Tighter police methods and swift and severe punishment for those proved to be engaged in kidnapping are on the way.\nWith respect to Niger Delta, Government is still engaging responsible leadership of the Communities to help in identifying and addressing genuine grievances of the region. Our clean-up programme in collaboration with the United Nations is making satisfactory progress.\nI am grateful to all the Governors and other Political & Community leaders of the Niger Delta States for their part in bringing relative peace to the areas.\nFinally let me again express my heartfelt thanks to all Nigerians who prayed for me during my illness last year. I feel deeply humbled by your prayers and good wishes and I am more determined than ever to serve you to the best of my ability.\nGood morning. And I wish everyone a Happy New Year.", "comments": "0", "shares": "0"}

George Chaponda by the High Court \u2013 following an injunction obtained by Kajoloweka;\n(2) The President sacking the implicated Minister from the Cabinet;\n(3) Former Minister, alongside two businesspersons Rashid Tayub of Transglobe Produce Export Limited and Grace Mijiga Mhango, who also chairs the Grain Traders and Processors Association of Malawi\u2014were arrested in connection with alleged corrupt practices during the procurement of maize, and are currently answering corruption charges in court pursued by the Anti-corruption Bureau (ACB);\n(4) Dismissal of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and other top Managers of the state-grain trader ADMARC implicated in the scandal. It must be further stressed that while the success to the maize gate was a collective effort with Parliamentary Committees led by Chidanti Malunga playing a crucial role in the later stages, it is in fact the litigation path taken by Kajoloweka and others (as mentioned above) which led to the obtaining of an injunction suspending Chaponda which was a critical juncture ( or great milestone and historical) in the whole maize gate saga as it led to great public attention on the issue and hence subsequent reactions from the executive and the legislature. It only required the boldness of an individual to lead such a legal path on such a sensitive issue.\nSecondly, in 2017, Kajoloweka as Executive Director of YAS led four civil society organisatons s namely Centre for Human Rights and Rehabilitation (CHRR), CEDEP and Church and Society of Livingstonia Synod, and YAS in yet another controversial accountability struggle, challenging the looting (abuse) of public resources from eight state institutions by the ruling party, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) through a fundraising dinner dubbed \u201cBlue Night\u201d.\nThe advocate and others are currently pursuing this case is in the High Court of Malawi, Zomba registry. This advocacy campaign will go a long way challenging impunity and abuse of public resources and public institutions by the ruling political parties in Malawi as well as re-enforcing the separation of government activities from those of ruling political parties.\nLastly, in November 2017, Kajoloweka as Executive Director of YAS together with CHRR is pursuing another high-risk accountability case in the Supreme Court of Appeal involving a Water pumping project by the Malawi Government through the Lilongwe Water Board \u2013 a state water authority.\nThe thrust of the case is that Lilongwe Water Board and other public institutions involved in the project flouted Environment Management Act and Public Procurement Act. YAS and CHRR believe that these issues are indicative of the rampant culture of flouting laws at various levels of public authorities and agencies which is often attended by corruption, hence must be challenged.\nIn summary, looking at the achievements he has done and then considering his age (a youth) Charles Kajoloweka is best suited for the Nyasa Times personality of the year.\nThe young man has not only been a blessing to the nation at large but also to the youth in Malawi that given the platform they can be able to courageously represent the interests of the marginalised and the voiceless. Kajoloweka background to activism can be traced to his days at Mzuzu University where he was the President of the Students Union.\nFollow and Subscribe Nyasa TV :\nSharing is caring!", "comments": "8", "shares": "0"}

Many of the students were orphaned in August.\nFrancis Abu Sankoh, a community leader, said the government had told him everyone eking out a precarious living had to get out by mid-November, but he refused to cooperate.\n\u201cWe will not force these people to leave while they still have nowhere else to stay,\u201d he told AFP, saying he knew of nearly 200 households living in half-finished structures in Regent.\nRelief workers are meanwhile exhausted after four months filling in for a government that is too under-resourced to carry out basic disaster management, with the Red Cross handing out its own payments of $300 to 1,000 people in late December.\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of government to provide financial support and housing for them,\u201d Crisafulli added, as he prepared for the imminent departure of around 100 pregnant women and new mothers.\nHe noted that the government had promised to give financial assistance to child victims via a mobile money wallet, but they were yet to receive anything. Children who lost their parents would remain at the center, he said.\nSome orphaned children were taken in by families, but many are too poor to feed another mouth while facing their own dire straits, said Cecelia Mansaray a project officer for British charity Street Child.\n\u201cPeople are still suffering months after the disaster,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have cases of people in unfinished buildings around Regent, Kaningo and Kamayama who had no place to go after they had left the emergency camps.\u201d\nIn the last 15 years, four major floods have affected more than 220,000 people in Sierra Leone and caused severe economic damage, according to a World Bank report issued in September.\nThis summer\u2019s was the deadliest yet: 1,141 people were declared dead or unaccounted for, according to official figures.\nThe World Bank estimates that $82.41 million is needed over the next three years for the recovery, or about 2.2 percent of the gross domestic product, including rebuilding the six health centers and 59 schools affected. Access to clean drinking water is also a serious problem.\nEfforts to resettle flood victims in previous years have failed, as the government has directed them to Mile Six, an area without transport links, running water or electricity \u2014 even if it is safe from the weather \u2014 meaning residents soon drift back to dangerous neighbourhoods that have easier commutes.\nIsmail Tarawali, head coordinator of the Office of National Security, which oversaw relief efforts, has accused some families of making \u201cfake claims\u201d for survivor packages.\nIn the medium to long term, Tarawali said affected households would be given extra relief \u2014 if there was money to pay for it.\nMeanwhile, 52 affordable houses with basic facilities are also under construction at Mile Six, and a mortgage scheme will be developed for survivors who had valid land permits for their damaged houses, he said.\nBut eligibility will likely only apply to a tiny fraction of the victims, while the rest will find themselves back where they already were, living on the edges of society with everything to lose from next year\u2019s floods.\nThis story has been published, courtesy of PRI International\nRelated", "comments": "0", "shares": "0"}

Dick\u2019s cult novel of the same name, blockchain is everywhere right now. The technology that underpins the bitcoin cryptocurrency and lots of other zeitgeisty developments, blockchain crops up as a miracle solution so often that you could be forgiven for thinking that it was the solution to all the world\u2019s problems. Unsurprisingly, the higher education sector has some intriguing ideas for how the technology could be used.\nA start-up company called Doctors Link has created a blockchain-based \u201cdigital passport\u201d for doctors, which gathers together a verifiable record of professional accreditation and training, while the University of Northampton-supported Blockchain Alliance for Good has developed a cryptocurrency that records social value (you could be receiving \u201ceduCoin\u201d for volunteering in the community, or for releasing your research data under a Creative Commons licence for reuse).\nAnother more controversial use of blockchain could be in reducing the friction of border checks and customs processes when the UK leaves the EU. And with today\u2019s economy predicated on a highly mobile professional workforce, the UK can use all the help we can get. But there\u2019s another side to Brexit that we need to be planning for: what happens if international students simply can\u2019t get to the UK to study at their universities and colleges of choice?\nLearning analytics for a better Brexit?\nSo how can we help international students who are no longer able to obtain visas? One way would be for institutions to step up their use of techniques like blended learning and augmented reality \u2013 and if we don\u2019t do it, someone else will.\nThe online education startup Udacity is promoting its \u201cnanodegree\u201d in self-driving car engineering. This is a wholly online course complemented by mentoring from engineers already working in this sector. What\u2019s really telling about this nanodegree is that no universities are involved \u2013 Udacity has completely bypassed the sector and gone directly to the firms that desperately need people with these new skills. Universities should be wary of being sidestepped by such programmes.\nLearning analytics could really help universities to stay ahead of the game; it\u2019s all about repurposing data that come out of our interactions with IT systems. This information is typically overlooked, but potentially has great value. Simple things like taking a library book out on loan or clicking on a link in the virtual learning environment can tell us a lot about how engaged a student is with their course. Putting these data together lets us use artificial intelligence to predict which interventions might help a student to achieve their full potential.\nAt Jisc we\u2019ve worked with software vendors and about 100 universities and colleges to create a national \u201clearning analytics service\u201d, along with common standards that we hope will be transferable internationally.\nGoing underground: academia takes to the \u2018Dark Web\u2019?\nIssues around freedom of movement are one problem higher education must contend with in 2018, but on both sides of the Atlantic there\u2019s also a distrust of experts and, yes, intellectuals (stoked by far Right media outlets). There is something insidious going on here \u2013 deliberate damage is being done to the scientific record and the practice of science.\nPerhaps the most notable example of this vandalism is in the field of climate change, with the wilful destruction of online climate data from some US federally funded programmes. It has been heartening to see the climate science community come together to preserve as much data as possible through collaborations like Data Refuge and Climate Mirror. It\u2019s not hard to see the crunchier end of academia being forced, in some countries, to resort to the tools of the Dark Web in order to continue functioning.\nLet\u2019s do everything we can to ensure that the UK doesn\u2019t become one of them.\nWe are all librarians\nAnother defining UK trend of recent years has been the forced closure of community centres and libraries as councils frantically struggle to reduce their expenditure. In many cases these facilities have reopened on a volunteer basis, but is there a role here for institutions in supporting their local community \u2013 for example, by letting staff participate in community-owned social enterprises like Libraries Unlimited, which now runs Devon\u2019s public libraries?\nIf we think about the future social purpose of our universities and colleges, there is a much deeper role here for our institutions \u2013 playing an active part in community and in the upskilling of children and adults alike.\nThe Code Club project from the Raspberry Pi Foundation has shown us the power of this kind of idea \u2013 there are now more than 6,000 Code Clubs in the UK alone, teaching coding to over 86,000 children. Our institutions could step up to play a more formal role, say by turning abandoned libraries into maker spaces, and reaching out to adults who desperately need up-to-date digital skills in order to find work.\nWhether it\u2019s being led by start-ups or social projects, edtech is taking its place centre stage within the higher education sector, and 2018 will no doubt see more developments afoot. Let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re ready to embrace the possibilities for positive change in our institutions and beyond.\nMartin Hamilton is a futurist at Jisc.\nThis article first appeared on THE\n\u00a9 2018, The Chronicle of Education.

{"articleId": "2107482075945358", "year": "2018", "month": "01", "day": "02", "publication": "ugandaobserver", "article_text": "The Archbishop of Kampala, Cyprian Kizito Lwanga has wasted no time in responding to President Yoweri Museveni's harsh criticism against the clergy in his New Year's message.\nYesterday, Museveni said religious leaders are behaving as if they are an authority on everything, speaking in favour of people they fancy so they can get them into political power.\n\"Some of our religious people are so full of arrogance. They talk most authoritatively on all and everything even when they have not bothered to find out the truth. This is assuming they do not have evil intentions which would be worse. That would make them into the Kayaffas, the Chief Priest, that betrayed Jesus\", Museveni said.\nBut less than 24 hours later, Archbishop Lwanga in his New Year's homily at Rubaga cathedral today hit back at the president, saying the clergy are simply playing their cardinal role as citizens to participate in nation building, and as well as resisting bad politics as President Museveni himself once asked Ugandans to.\n\"The president, one day said all of us belong to the Movement system and he explained to us why he started the National Resistance Movement. He said; 'I want people to resist [] bad politics'. So he commanded people to resist bad politics. He said we should resist bad politics, and I think he was right there. Clap for it [loud and long clapping]. Let us resist bad politics, let us resist bad politics and promote national unity because we\u2019re all interested in this country and also to build a strong future for this country\", Lwanga said.\nThis was the gist of Dr Lwanga's New Year's message that hinged on promoting democracy, good governance and resisting bad politics. Since the tabling of the age limit bill in September and its subsequent passing by parliament in December last year, religious leaders have increasingly become more critical of the political leadership especially members of parliament for ignoring the views of their people on the bill.\nThe controversial and largely unpopular bill, lifts the upper age limit previously capped at 75 years. It also lowered the lower age limit from 35 to 18 years. Following the clergy's fierce criticism, government spokesperson Ofwono Opondo said the religious leaders had overstepped their mandate. He implored them to stand for political positions if they want their views to be considered.\nToday, every time Archbishop Lwanga quoted the Constitution on freedom of expression or Museveni's historical remarks, he was loudly cheered by the congregation. He referred to the National Resistance Movement (NRM's) 10-point Programme stipulated by Museveni in his book, Sowing the Mustard Seed, as a good guide in the work of national renewal.\nLwanga said as he read the 10-point programme that in democracy, people give in their views and then governments choose the best. \"All these ten points are very good for nation building,\" he said amidst applause.\nLwanga noted that all Ugandans have the duty to promote not division or bad politics but national unity for the development of the country.\n\"Another good guide in this country in our work of national renewal, is the 10-point programme of the National Resistance Movement stipulated by the president in his book, Sowing the Mustard Seed. He enumerated the 10 points, By the way, they are very interesting .\nThe first one is to restore democracy. What does that mean? People trade in views and then you choose the best. Two; restoration of security of person and property\u2026consolidation of nation unity and elimination of all forms of sectarianism. So we all have a duty to promote nothing else, not divisions but national unity. These 10 point programme are very good for nation building. We thank our dear president for having highlighted them in his book. Let us implement them and do nothing else but for God and our country,\" Lwanga said.\nNot done, Archbishop Lwanga went on to remind the president and Ofwono Opondo, the Uganda Media Centre executive director and government spokesperson, who last week argued that religious leaders, who, think they command people's thoughts are deceiving themselves that the Constitution grants everyone the freedom of expression.\nOpondo accused Lwanga last week of letting his congregation heckle the Vice President Edward Kiwanuka Ssekandi as he delivered his Christmas message. Lwanga said religious leaders are citizens whose freedom of expression is enshrined in Article 29 of the Constitution \"if it has not also been amended.\"\n\"We have all the right to speak, Article 29 stipulates the protection of freedom of conscience, freedom of own expression, freedom of movement. This means, that every citizen or every person has a right to freedom of speech and expression, freedom of thoughts.\nAll of us should therefore be aware that the life of our nation is not a responsibility of a few individuals alone but a common social responsibility of all citizens of this country. I therefore appeal to all concerned especially politicians or even journalists, please read and understand the Constitution of Uganda before making abusive utterances on innocent people - be it religious leaders, politicians or others. That Constitution is for all us without any category of people,\" he added.\nOn Opondo's suggestions that the clergy remove their cassocks and join the murky waters of politics, Lwanga said religious leaders are not and will not be interested in politics but their views must be respected as well.\n\"Today people are calling us, especially religious leaders names and even at times abusing us, saying religious leaders must not talk about national issues. 'If they want to talk about them, let them come out and stand for political posts'. I would like to assure everybody, don't get worried of us. We\u2019re not interested in political posts.\nWhat we\u2019re just doing is our work. So whoever maybe worried that we do what we do and say what we say because we want to stand, it is not true. We\u2019re not interested and we shall not have interest either. What is being said is a wrong approach which diverts people from the sovereignty of the people which the national Constitution gives us all\u2026Amongst the duties stipulated of a citizen in the Constitution, is to respect the freedom and rights of others to speak\"", "comments": "92", "shares": "175"}

Any position of leadership in the country wouldn\u2019t even be worth contesting anymore. Maybe that would be a nice thing, as the survivors would be spared the nastiness of political contests.\nThank God 2017 is done. It has certainly brought out the nastiest side of us Ugandans.\nIn 2018, we must behave better, otherwise if the 2017 trend continues, we will be in real trouble. Any position of leadership in the country wouldn\u2019t even be worth contesting anymore. Maybe that would be a nice thing, as the survivors would be spared the nastiness of political contests.\nOne of the nastiest developments in 2017 was how people shared and laughed at morbid jokes. It so happened that several prominent people died in the country, and the social media went into overdrive with lurid jokes about their deaths. It became customary to expect imaginary conversations to be posted on social media between the dead person and those who died earlier as they meet in hell.\nWhen the imaginary conversations between the dead became tiring, they started posting conversations between the dead and the living. When the social media script writers got tired of those, they started serving up lies by announcing deaths of people who are still alive and well.\nLiving people pronounced dead included a prominent retired clergyman and a young woman married to a top musician. Then there was a prominent educationist who died after he built several quality high schools and several dozen children were presented as his biological products at the funeral. The jokes about how he managed this and what he proceeded to do in hell almost choked the Internet.\nWhy this bizarre behaviour became popular is unclear. Is it due to economic frustration or increasing alcoholism?\nAt the high leadership levels, the country trended in world media when our national parliament in September became an arena of a brawl between unidentified security men and dozens of MPs, whom the former were trying to evict after the Speaker suspended them.\nThis was over a Bill to remove the age limits on the presidency, which has since been passed. The men conducting the arrests were not parliamentary police, and it is still unclear how they gained access to the chamber.\nThe Speaker has written to the President, who is also the Commander-in-Chief, demanding an explanation. She is yet to get one as far as the public knows. Several expelled MPs suffered serious injuries and were hospitalised.\nThen for several months, dozens of young women were raped, tortured and brutally murdered in two locations close to the capital. Then a few senior security officers were arrested by the army for allegedly selling off refugees back to the very foreign powers they had fled from. The case is till ongoing in the court martial.\nThe year closed on another bizarre note, when a gang of notorious killers and robbers appeared on national television announcing that they had denounced crime and were instead now co-operating with authorities to fight it.\nThen they confused the public by saying their problem was that senior security officials are still trying to deploy them on robbery missions. One fellow ,who had been trying to literally buy his way to fame, has ushered in the new year in prison, charged with shooting his neighbour.\nThe man suddenly appeared on the scene and started donating money to people who were lining up with petitions to have their financial problems solved. Then, without warning, he picked up a gun, shot and seriously wounded his neighbour. Keeping up with the happenings in Uganda can be dizzying.\nJoachim Buwembo is a social and political commentator based in Kampala.", "comments": "0", "shares": "0"}

Pregnant women also received gifts as she said they should be celebrated because they were the ones who bring life into this world.\nRead more:\n\u201cThe problem of orphaned, abandoned and vulnerable children, women, and girls is close to my heart. It is a problem that is not unique to Zimbabwe, but goes beyond our borders, regionally and internationally. However, the fact that it is a common problem is not a justification for us to let the situation worsen,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAs Zimbabweans, closely knitted family structures are a vital part of our culture. Surely, we are all relatives of these children. Most of us have the capacity to accommodate them. We can take them in within our homes. Adoption is also an option that we have and we should demystify and embrace it. There is no need to fear and remain in ignorance. We should educate each other and remove the myths and unfounded social cultural beliefs that hinder us from talking care of our own.\u201d\nThe First Lady said children\u2019s homes came about as a result of instances where parents did not have the capacity to take care of their children and opted for better care in the homes.\nShe said the growing number of children\u2019s homes in the country was a cause for concern, which needed a collective solution.\n\u201cWhat is saddening is that some of these children are mentally challenged or disabled, requiring special care. These homes are regarded as a last resort, hence their increasing numbers is now a major concern. We should collectively interrogate the push factors and explore preventive mechanisms. The mere existence of the 14 children\u2019s homes here in Manicaland to me is the initial indication of a desire to provide for children\u2019s needs although it is in an alternate setting from the traditional family set-up,\u201d she said.\nShe commended the efforts of the children\u2019s homes in the province and encouraged them to continue raising independent, disciplined, respectable ambitious and capable individuals.\nThe First Lady\u2019s visit is part of nationwide visits she has been conducting to acquaint herself with issues pertaining to the social sector.\n\u201cThis is driven not only by my portfolio as the First Lady, but my passion for socio-transformation and improvement of livelihoods as a mother. I believe that going personally to meet the people and seeing first hand their predicament is the effective mechanism that will make one understand the people\u2019s needs and the existing gaps that require intervention,\u201d she said.\nShe called on those who run orphanages to ensure that the children they raise experience the same childhood as those in traditional family set-ups.\nSpeaking at the same occasion, Minister of State for Manicaland Provincial Affairs, Senator Monica Mutsvangwa, said: \u201cThe visit to this place shows that you (First Lady Mnangagwa) value these children.\n\u201cIf they are valued, they will also have a sense of self-worth, which is important for them to grow up into confident adults.\u201d\nSen Mutsvangwa said Manicaland should utilise the abundant vast natural resources available in the province to take care of the orphaned children.\n\u201cIf we do this, we can take care of our children and there will be no children who do not go to school. For us to succeed, we should use what we have and be able to take care of these children and change their lives for better,\u201d she said.", "comments": "36", "shares": "6"}

The Meeting also approved the appointment of Foresight Accounting Firm as the new External Auditors of the Federation for the next three (3) years, as decided by last year\u2019s AGM.\nIn addition to the above, the Meeting approved the following amendments of the GFF Statute, including an Eligibility Check and Term Limits for Elective Positions in the GFF Executive: 1. Article 34 of the Constitution was amended by inserting a new article, 34A: \u201cthe Executive Committee may co-opt up to two members into the Executive based on their technical competence and subject to them passing Eligibility Check to be conducted with the assistance of FIFA or CAF\u201d. 2. Article 34.4 of the Constitution was also amended by inserting the following new paragraph; (e): \u201cpass Eligibility Check to be conducted with the assistance of FIFA or CAF\u201d. This means that for one to be qualified to be elected into the GFF Executive, he/she shall Pass an Eligibility Check. 3. Article 41.1 of the Constitution was also amended to ensure that the President and Executive Committee shall be re-elected only once for a four year term. However, the current term of the current President and the current Executive shall not be counted. 4. Article 23 was amended to increase the number of delegates/votes of Regional Football Associations and Allied Associations to 4 and 3 respectively. This was sequel to the decision of last year\u2019s AGM to increase the number of teams in the First and Second Divisions to 14 and 16 teams respectively effective in 2018/19 League Season. In order to create a balance in voting power of members, the 2016 AGM tasked a three man Task Force to work out a formula for the increment based on principle of proportionality. As a result, the first and second division clubs shall henceforth have a total of 30 votes, representing 41.10 percent of the total votes while the allied associations shall now have 15 votes, representing 20.55 percent and the regional football associations shall now have 28 votes, representing 38.36 percent of the total votes; increasing the Total Number of votes to 73. In the area of competition, the Meeting also approved the proposal of the Executive that effective 2018/19 Season, the champions of Lower River, Central River, North Bank and Upper River Regions will directly qualify to the Second Division of the National League, whilst those of Banjul, Kanifing Municipality and West Coast Region will compete in a triangular qualifier to fill the remaining One Spot for the Second Division. 5. The Meeting unanimously confirmed the decision of the Executive Committee to suspend Mr. Bakary Paco Dampha for blocking a GFF FF Cup match between Gamtel and Samger on April 8, 2017 at the Serekunda East Mini Stadium, and Mr. Lamin Jarju the defeated candidate for the presidency of the West Coast Region Football Association earlier this year, for taking a football matter before a civil court by suing the President and Secretary General of the said Regional Football Association. Both cases are considered to be very serious violations of the GFF Constitution. The duo was earlier suspended by the Executive Committee and it was the mandate of the General Assembly to validate or otherwise such decision. As required by Article 16.1 of the GFF Statute, the two cases were separately voted on and each passed with attaining the required two-thirds majority of the total votes cast. Thus upholding the suspension of the two gentlemen indefinitely, with Mr. Jarju having the option to withdraw the case from the court and his suspension lifted.\nThe members also renewed their support to the current leadership for the unprecedented strides that the national game has attained in recent years. They also unanimously condemned the actions of the National Sports Council/Ministry of Youth and Sports for meddling into the internal matters of the Federation. They also decried the latest attempt by some individuals to hide behind the National Assembly Select Committee on Sports to force the GFF to comply with an illegal process, even after an Executive intervention seemed to have broken the impasse. Describing the actions of these interest groups as selfish and becoming unbearable, members called for a stop to what they referred to as a witch-hunt and instead urged them to join hands with the GFF to develop the game in the country. Members also urged the Government, cum Ministry of Youth and Sports, to fulfil their commitments of sponsoring the national teams. The GFF President reassured the delegates that the position of the Executive, not to associate themselves with an illegitimate process, will never change irrespective of the circumstances. The event had earlier began with the President, Lamin Kaba Bajo\u2019s, introductory remark and the approval of the agenda followed by the adoption of last year\u2019s minutes. Mr. Bajo said the GFF under his leadership places a very high priority on articulating its core competency in good governance, sound financial management and genuine partnership with its stakeholders including, but not limited to, Government, Clubs, Affiliated Associations, WAFU, CAF and FIFA. He further remarked that the GFF have made concrete plans to move the game forward in terms of national football development, capacity building, grassroots and women football, regional leagues, national teams, infrastructure development, fund raising and marketing for a healthy financial standing.\n\u201cThe Plan also includes targets and milestones for implementing improved management information systems in the areas of finance, human resources and project management for the Regional Football Associations, which culminated with the hiring of Coaches and Administrative/Financial Secretaries at the Regional Football Associations,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartening to report that the furnishing of the GFF Hotel has been completed, the Senior Management Team is recruited, and a Board of Directors appointed to oversee the operations of the Hotel. I am pleased to inform you that the Hotel has since started operations, though at a small scale. If all goes well with the project, it will serve as a new source of income for the Federation which will greatly reduce our financial dependence on FIFA/CAF and the government, and also significantly reduce our expenditure in the camping of national teams and conducting of technical training programmes. This is a landmark achievement in the history of football administration in this country.\u201d\nDespite the above achievements, the President noted that the past year has been a very challenging one for the Federation notwithstanding due to the avoidable crisis that arose between the GFF and the National Sports Council. \u201cIt was unfortunate we were not giving the opportunity to familiarise ourselves and work with the new leadership of both the Ministry and NSC, instead we found ourselves in an unnecessary impasse, which has created tension and acrimony between us. As we have been saying throughout the impasse, we are not afraid of an investigation as our hands are clean and our conscience is clear as far as the handling of the funds of the funds and management of the Federation are concerned. All we were insisting on was the following of due process and that the actions of all should be dictated and guided by laws and existing rules and regulations, as we operate within the dictates of the GFF Constitution, the FIFA and CAF Statutes, and the national laws of the country,\u201d he emphasised.\nMr. Bajo added that despite the challenges, which ran over several weeks, peace has finally showed up her face when the Minister made a public statement calling for peace and reconciliation to enable bygones be bygones and that the purported investigations was being discontinued. He said he later held a successful meeting with Minister Gomez, where they both agreed to give peace a chance.", "comments": "0", "shares": "0"}

Bah\nDrivers plying the Brikama-Basse highway have decried the unusual crossing of cattle on the trans-Gambia main highway as animal distraction increases at an alarming rate. It has been noticed over the years that drivers knock down animals crossing the highway leading to cattle and even human fatalities. This reporter witnessed a near miss collision of a bus and a calf that was following some cows crossing the highway. This could have resulted in an accident if the driver did not miss the calf. According to the bus driver, it is a big risk when driving on the trans-Gambia highway nowadays as animals of all sort, cross the highway to reach water points; that most of the time, they have to make split-second diversions when they come across animals crossing the highway which they said lead some drivers in the wrong direction, and causing accidents.\nOne of the drivers called on livestock owners to keep their animals away from the road; that the Gambia Livestock Association should take the lead in making sure that animals are protected and kept domestically. He said drivers are always troubled psychologically and economically, when they hit animals as owners will sometimes claim cash or curse them. This the driver said, is a burning issue for drivers and called on the authorities to intervene so that they can carry on their noble work to carry people and goods safely.\nAnother \u201cGelle-gelle\u201d driver said he was lucky to have managed a near miss collision after spotting cattle from a distance; that otherwise he would have ran over them and probably kill or injure them or hurt his passengers; that donkeys are the main contributors to the high incidence of road accidents because they don\u2019t move away from the road when a vehicle approaches them. Muhammed Camara is a livestock owner living on the Bakadagi-Mankama Kunda road side. Camara said they are not to be blamed for not keeping their animals away from the road; that the settlement is known for animal rearing and drivers should be very cautious when driving around the area; that drivers will be responsible when they hit his animals because the area is a human settlement that has animals.\nAccording to him, it is difficult to pen the animals in a permanent place depriving them of their rights to movement and grazing; that animals sometimes need to be idle to fend for them themselves. Other animal owners express similar concerns. The major causes of accidents they said is the over speeding of the drivers.", "comments": "0", "shares": "0"}

Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\" Trump tweeted.\nKim's address came amid growing tension\nKim said Monday in his annual New Year's Day address that \"The entire mainland of the US is within the range of our nuclear weapons and the nuclear button is always on the desk of my office. They should accurately be aware that this is not a threat but a reality.\"\nIn the address, Kim also expressed a desire for a peaceful resolution with South Korea, a break from the aggressive language he used to threaten the US.\nTrump, as part of his Tuesday morning tweetstorm, said the potentially warm gesture to South Korea from Kim is \"perhaps\" good news, \"perhaps not,\" and referred to \"sanctions and 'other' pressures\" on North Korea.\nPress secretary Sarah Sanders said at the White House news briefing that the US approach to North Korea had not changed, that the US continues to regard North Korea as a global threat and seeks an international solution while keeping \"all of our options on the table.\"\nTrump has repeatedly made statements about North Korea via Twitter. The President said it was a waste of time for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to negotiate with North Korea -- referring to Kim in the tweet as \"Little Rocket Man\" -- shortly after the US diplomat said he hoped to de-escalate the standoff through talks. After a North Korean statement insulted Trump by calling him a \"dotard,\" the US President tweeted that he would \"NEVER\" call the North Korean leader \"short and fat,\" while also saying that \"maybe someday\" he would be Kim's friend.\nSouth Korea initially receptive to possible dialogue\nRecent years have seen North Korea display increasing strength in its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile development, while Kim makes provocative statements threatening to attack his enemies. In November, North Korea claimed it had the capability to attack any part of the US mainland.\nThe UN Security Council has voted to ratchet up sanctions in response to the continued development of North Korea's nuclear program. Last month, the US conducted another round of military exercises with South Korea, which Kim called for South Korea to end in his New Year's statement.\nBut Kim's call for talks between the two countries at the beginning of the year struck many observers as noteworthy, and South Korean leadership has been receptive to Kim's potential openness to dialogue. The spokesman for South Korean President Moon Jae-in said South Korea also hoped for a resolution between the two countries.\nMoon said he would look to restore communication between the South and the isolated North, and that he welcomed North Korea participating in the Winter Olympic Games, which South Korea is hosting next month.

Muluzi has been maintained since then.\nMuluzi has disputed suggestions that by entering into a working relationship with the DPP, he sold the party; arguing he accepted to help run the country because he wanted unity and development.\nThe youthful Muluzi, whose father Bakili Muluzi, ruled the country between 1994 and 2004, said UDF was strong and he could not sell it any at cost.\nPrior to the May 20 2014 Tripartite Elections, Muluzi had also taken UDF into a working relationship with People\u2019s Party (PP) after then president Joyce Banda appointed him and several UDF legislators into Cabinet in 2012.\nMuluzi quit Banda\u2019s Cabinet close to the election and launched what he called an \u2018Agenda for Change\u2019 that sought to transform the country. However, he finished a distant fourth in the presidential race.\nFollow and Subscribe Nyasa TV :\nSharing is caring!", "comments": "54"}
