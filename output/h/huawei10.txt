Originally launched in 2017, Huawei’s P smart series offers great value for quality, performance, user experience and innovative features. Enter the Huawei P smart 2019, the successor to the popular P smart. Not only does it improve on every aspect of its predecessor; it also features the more powerful octa-core Kirin 710 chipset and the much-talked about new Dewdrop display, which drastically reduces the size of the notch and. The smaller the notch, the less it cuts into the all-important screen real estate that many other manufacturers struggle to find a solution to preserving as much as possible. The 2019 edition incorporates some the latest technology and designs to deliver a more sophisticated experience that caters to the dynamic needs of today’s consumers. Flagship display and design Comparing the Huawei P smart 2019 with its predecessors, consumers will immediately recognise the more expansive viewing area made possible by the 6.21-inch 19.5:9 Huawei Dewdrop Display. Besides a physically larger screen, the new Huawei smartphone replaces the upper bezel with an unobtrusive pearl-shaped notch that houses the front camera, and completely removes the lower bezel. This allows the display to achieve a modern, almost bezel-less face. Given how consumers are spending more and more time with their smartphones and the effects of harmful high-energy blue light to eye fatigue and sleep cycles, the Huawei P smart 2019 features a new TÜV Rheinland-certified Eye Comfort Mode, which effectively filters out these harmful high-energy blue light. Powerful AI Dual Camera Alongside a more premium display, the Huawei P smart 2019 is equipped with improved front and rear cameras. At the front, embedded in the dewdrop notch is a 16MP wide-aperture (f/2.0) selfie camera. The selfie camera of P smart 2019 supports new AI and AR capabilities, and improved user experience features such as gesture control. Portrait mode allows users to easily apply beautifying effects in the virtual viewfinder, a great way to touch-up selfies after-the-fact. The front camera also recognises and optimises eight categories of common selfie backgrounds, so users can snap freely and still produce social-worthy selfies. The AI Dual Camera system can produce studio-quality portraits. AI operates in the background to intelligently recognise more than 500 scenes and provide real-time optimisations, bridging the skill gap between a photography amateur and a professional. The Huawei AI image stabilisation works in harmony with the wide-aperture lens to produce bright, detailed, low-noise night photos without the need for a tripod. Huawei P smart 2019 is equipped with the new Kirin 710 chipset with a clock speed of up to 2.2GHz. Kirin 710 ensures a smooth, natural system response, immersive gaming performance and excellent power efficiency. EMUI 9.0 comes standard on the Huawei P Smart 2019. The latest Huawei custom Android 9 Pie-based operating system combined with GPU Turbo 2.0, the latest iteration of Huawei’s AI-powered graphics processing solution, the GPU power efficiency is doubled while granting up to 30% better GPU performance on Huawei P smart 2019. This capability enables the P smart 2019 to deliver a stable, high frame-rate experience across all mobile entertainment scenarios. Battery power The Huawei P smart 2019’s large 3400mAh battery provides all-day battery life supporting up to 10 hours of internet browsing on 4G networks, up to 18 hours of continuous video playback, and up to a ground-breaking 96 hours of continuous music playback. The smart battery management system also applies several measures to further extend the battery life, including suspending minimised apps to significantly prolong battery life of the device on idle. Beauty that belies ruggedness Launching in two colourways, midnight black and aurora blue, the P smart 2019 is beautifully ergonomic. The 3D curved unibody design comes with a glossy, ceramic-like back that gives the smartphone a premium look and feel. As smartphones have become such an integral part of the modern lifestyle, a daily driver must be built to weather wear and tear from frequent use. Huawei has engineered the P smart 2019 to be extremely durable. The various components have been rigorously tested in Huawei’s testing facilities. For instance, both the power button and fingerprint sensor can withstand 200,000 triggers and still work really well. Available in midnight black and aurora blue, the recommended retail price for the Huawei P smart 2019 is R4,999 at all operators and selected retailers.

In 2020, will the wow factor return to consumer hardware? Will blockchain and 5G punch into the mainstream? Or will the world unify against Big Tech’s tax-avoiding practices? AFP looks at five themes shaping the world of technology, after a year in which debate intensified over the industry’s exploitation of its customers’ privacy. – 5G’s unfulfilled promise – Super-fast fifth-generation network speeds are meant to revolutionise communications along with areas like urban transport. But so far, 5G has failed to meet expectations due to the lagging build of infrastructure in many places. Apple has yet to launch a compatible phone, unlike rivals including Samsung. Wipro is adding a layer of smarts and security to your homes with its new smart doorbell. The rollout should quicken next year as more countries install base stations and networking equipment — although US President Donald Trump’s war on Chinese sector leader Huawei remains a wild card. As smartphone sales plateau around the world, manufacturers have been focussing more on ancillary services. “You have to sell the entire experience, the entire ecosystem,” Dominique Bindels, senior analyst for home and tech with London-based research firm Euromonitor International, told AFP. Highlighting Apple’s success in payments and peripheral devices such as AirPods, Bindels predicted that smart earphones, along with speakers and at-home devices connected on the “internet of things”, would be among the more dynamic sectors in 2020. Digital assistants such as Alexa and Siri may start talking to each other, after Amazon, Apple and Google this month formed an alliance with other industry players to develop a common standard for smart home devices. Another trend could be consolidation in TV streaming, after Apple and Disney joined Netflix, Amazon Video and some national broadcasters in a crowded subscription market. – Leap into the quantum dark – For the industry at large, business consultancy Accenture this year coined the acronym DARQ to denote four major trends: distributed ledger technology (such as blockchain), artificial intelligence (AI), extended reality and quantum computing. Unbreakable blockchain networks of computers have already been generating virtual currencies in the form of bitcoin and its ilk, bypassing the need for a regulator like a government or central bank. Facebook wants to make the tech respectable through its “Libra” project, but has hit political opposition around the world, and several financial partners have pulled out. Unwilling to let private enterprise dictate terms, China and other nations are building their own digital payments systems, which could see fruition next year. However, blockchain networks devour huge amounts of energy, and concerns will mount about their environmental impact as debate intensifies more broadly about tech’s contribution to climate change. – The price of privacy – Most companies are now actively engaged across the spectrum of another tech acronym, SMAC: social, mobile, analytics and cloud. For consumers, SMAC is felt in how we communicate with friends and how we search and shop. That is accentuating fears about privacy, after a series of data leaks at Facebook first laid bare how much of our online lives are exploited by companies and political parties. “People are becoming more conscious of sharing data but also in the same moment, the Nest cameras and smart speakers are flying off the shelves,” said Bindels. “There’s a huge divide. People have been learning to trade privacy for convenience. It’s just another currency.” Amnesty International, in a hard-hitting study last month into Facebook and Google, said that tradeoff amounts to a “Faustian bargain” which imperils our human rights. – Tech wars – To Beijing’s anger, Washington alleges that Huawei and another telecoms group, ZTE, are little more than shell fronts for Chinese spy chiefs. Ni Lexiong, professor at the Shanghai National Defense Strategy Institute, said US sanctions depriving those firms of access to US components would only encourage China to stand on its own feet. “In the end, once China has formed its own industrial chain in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States will also lose a large market,” he said. Samm Sacks, an expert on China’s digital economy at the Washington think tank New America, said the tech standoff could harm progress in areas such as precision medicine and AI-based diagnoses. The two countries have cooperated in research, “and severing that could have global consequences”, she warned. – Taxing times – The US presidential election next November will likely prove another flashpoint over disinformation peddled on social media. Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren wants Amazon, Facebook and Google to be broken up on anti-trust grounds. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is meanwhile due by June 2020 to present a “unified approach” for richer countries to levy a digital tax on internet giants. Some like France have gone ahead with their own tax, igniting another front in Trump’s multifaceted trade wars as the US threatens tariffs on a range of French goods.

The US Commerce Department blacklisted five Chinese tech entities on Friday in a new move against Beijing’s supercomputing industry likely to raise tensions ahead of a meeting between President Trump and Xi Jinping next week. The notice targets Sugon – a prominent Chinese supercomputer manufacturer – along with three of its microchip subsidiaries and a computing institute owned by the People’s Liberation Army. All of the entities will be effectively barred from obtaining US technology after the government determined they were “acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” Trade tensions between the world’s top two economies have spilled over into the tech sector in recent months, with Trump’s administration moving to essentially ban Chinese tech firm Huawei from the huge US market on security grounds. In May, it added Huawei to an “entity list” of companies barred from receiving US-made components without permission from Washington, though the company was granted a 90-day reprieve. Facebook and Google have since both announced they will move to cut off Huawei in order to comply with the US sanctions, further isolating the Chinese tech giant. Beijing has responded with threats to release its own blacklist of “unreliable” foreign companies and individuals that appears aimed at pressuring foreign companies to maintain commercial relations with Huawei. Earlier this month, Beijing summoned executives from American firms Dell and Microsoft and South Korea’s Samsung, among others, to warn them that any moves to ramp down their businesses in China may lead to retaliation, The New York Times reported. Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi are set to meet next week on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. For more news your way, download The Citizen’s app for iOS and Android.

Facebook said Friday it would cut off Huawei from its popular social networking apps to comply with US sanctions, further isolating the Chinese tech giant considered a national security threat by Washington. The social media giant said it took the step after President Donald Trump’s order barring Huawei from US technology exports over concerns that it works with Chinese intelligence. “We are reviewing the Commerce Department’s final rule and the more recently issued temporary general license and taking steps to ensure compliance,” a Facebook spokesperson told AFP. The California company said people with existing Huawei smartphones with Facebook apps will continue to be able to use and download app updates provided by Facebook. The move by Facebook is the latest to isolate Huawei, which had become the world’s second-largest smartphone vendor despite security concerns voiced in Washington. Google last month said it would cut ties to Huawei, making it harder to obtain major apps from the US giant. The Google decision would leave Huawei without the Play Store, the marketplace for most Android apps, and other elements of the mobile operating system. Facebook — which is banned in China but has more than two billion users worldwide — said its decision would affect its core social network as well as applications such as Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, which each have at least one billion users. The US sanctions were imposed May 15, but the administration allowed a 90-day compliance period that gives users of Huawei devices time to install updates and avoid a major disruption of the mobile economy. Isolating Huawei Huawei has indicated it would create its own operating system to replace the Google Android platform, but would need to develop its own app marketplace as well if it wants to retain users outside China. To keep up in the smartphone market, Huawei would also need to find a new supply of chips and related hardware, without US suppliers such as Intel, Qualcomm and Broadcom. To make matters more difficult for Huawei, it will likely be cut off from ARM Holdings, the British designer of semiconductors whose technology is used in most mobile chips. Trump’s move came amid US concerns that Huawei, a leader in 5G networks, would allow Chinese snooping on the high-speed wireless networks. His administration has also been trying to stop US allies from using Huawei equipment. Trump told reporters last month that Huawei was “very dangerous” from a security standpoint but then held out the possibility of dropping sanctions on the Chinese firm as part of a trade deal. The fight over Huawei comes amid a broader trade war between the two largest economies and sanctions imposed by the US president, who accuses China of unfair practices and subsidies.

A second Canadian who had gone missing in China is under investigation on suspicion of “engaging in activities that harm China’s national security”, state media reported Thursday. Michael Spavor was “being investigated” by the Dandong city branch of China’s ministry of state security and the probe started on December 10, according to a government news agency in northeastern Liaoning province. Michael Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat, was detained by Chinese state security on Monday in Beijing, according to his employer, the International Crisis Group think tank. Kovrig too is suspected of “engaging in activities” that endanger China’s national security, according to a report Wednesday by Beijing News, a local newspaper. The reported investigations of two Canadian nationals come more than a week after Ottawa infuriated Beijing by arresting Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei, at Washington’s request. Meng was released on Can$10 million (US$7.5 million) bail by a court in Vancouver on Tuesday. For more news your way, download The Citizen’s app for iOS and Android.

WSJ reported this week that Huawei technicians helped Ugandan and Zambian authorities use spyware to intercept opponent's communications. WSJ said Huawei's assistance enabled Ugandan authorities to disrupt Wine's plans for concerts they feared would turn into political rallies. Huawei is the world's number two smartphone producer and is considered the global leader in fifth-generation or 5G equipment. Uganda and Zambia on Friday denied a report that employees of Chinese telecom giant Huawei had helped them spy on political opponents. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported this week that Huawei technicians helped the two African governments intercept communications and social media activity of their opponents, while also tracking their movements. The article also reported that Huawei operated a video and cyber surveillance system in Algeria, which the company denied. Algeria's foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment. In Uganda, WSJ reported that Huawei technicians helped Ugandan authorities use spyware to monitor pop star turned opposition icon Bobi Wine. Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, became a lawmaker in 2017 and is preparing to challenge President Yoweri Museveni in Uganda's 2021 presidential election. According to The Wall Street Journal, Huawei's assistance enabled Ugandan authorities to disrupt Wine's plans for concerts they feared would turn into political rallies. "It is totally false to claim Huawei helped African governments among them Uganda spy on its political opponents," Ugandan presidential spokesman Don Wanyama told AFP. "Why spy on Bobi Wine?" Meanwhile Zambian government spokeswoman Dora Siliya on Twitter slammed the WSJ report, which said Huawei technicians helped authorities spy on opposition bloggers running a news site critical of President Edgar Lungu. "The WSJ article on government spying on political opponents is malicious, we refute it with the contempt it deserves," wrote Siliya. Huawei is the world's number two smartphone producer and is considered the global leader in fifth-generation or 5G equipment. But it is facing pushback in some Western markets over suspicions that it provides a backdoor for Chinese intelligence services. There are also concerns that Huawei's involvement in the development of foreign 5G networks could enable Beijing to gain access to critical infrastructure. It has been blacklisted by US President Donald Trump purportedly because of espionage concerns. The Wall Street Journal said its reporting "didn't turn up evidence of spying by or on behalf of Beijing in Africa". But it described how an official with the Chinese Embassy in Kampala accompanied Ugandan officials to China where they visited Huawei's headquarters and received "details on the surveillance systems it has built around the world". In a Twitter post Thursday, the embassy said the report was "PURE FAKE NEWS and TOTALLY GROUNDLESS!" Wine, who has been detained multiple times since entering politics, told AFP Friday that the spying claims were "not surprising" but warned Museveni that underhanded efforts to stop his political rise would fail. "Let him be reminded that Ugandans hold the key to their problems and no foreign interventions can stop the wind of change in the country," he said. The WSJ article also said that a team of Ugandan security officials had visited the Algerian capital in 2017 to study a video surveillance system that included mass monitoring and cyber-surveillance centers. One official told the newspaper that during their visit they had discussed "hacking individuals in the opposition who can threaten national security". Huawei in a statement rejected the "unfounded and false allegations about its commercial operations in Algeria, Uganda and Zambia." The statement said that Huawei's professional code of conduct prevents any activity that compromises the data or private life of its clients.
