Last year, the Kenyan government in partnership with Huawei and Safaricom introduced a low cost internet connection in an effort to boost internet connectivity particularly in Kenya’s rural homes. According to a Huawei report released in June 2018, Kenya ranked top in sub-Saharan Africa in internet connectivity and investment enabling technology. Samuel Baraza, a 31-year old entrepreneur is one of the many young and ambitious entrepreneurs who are ready to tap into these Information Communication and Technology opportunities to empower individuals, groups and Non-Governmental Organizations who possess creative ideas implement their projects. With his indispensable 10 year working experience in the ICT world, Baraza, who also doubles as the Co-founder and CEO of Skyzone Communications Limited, decided to kick start Cuberise Projects Campaign in 2018 with the aim of helping innovative projects come to life. “Cuberise Projects Campaign is an online crowd funding platform aimed at creating employment by raising funds for worthwhile projects that alleviate poverty, conserve the environment and have a positive impact for the wider good,” says the Kenyatta University Computer Science and MBA in Strategic Management graduate. Baraza says economic forces motivated him to start the online platform owing to the fact that most of the budding start-up entrepreneurs went to the venture capitalist firms but hardly got any funding. “It’s never about the strength of your idea but who you know among the panelists. We are targeting those who are cut off by the panelists just because they are not ‘known’. We are democratizing the whole idea of funding by showcasing creative ideas to the whole world and reaping from the economies of scale,” says Baraza. To this end, Cuberise has conducted six campaign projects with one already fully funded. Key among these campaign project is one aimed at supporting a former Makini school teacher, Martin Omamo publish his book dubbed Sunset at Midday. “Sunset at Midday takes us into the real life journey of a man who suffered a brain tumor at the apex of his career that left him blind and dependent on those around him. The book serves as a testament of perseverance and faith against insurmountable odds,” says Baraza. The platform has also helped raised funds for the Athi River Saints and Kitengela All Stars basketball team which was seeking financial support for registration to participate at the coveted Nairobi Basketball Associations Championship commencing mid-March this year. A glimpse at the Cuberise Project Campaign website shows that NBA championships campaign managed to surpass its target by over 10 percent and has now embarked on a second project campaign aimed at helping the 32 member basketball team procure balls and other crucial paraphernalia. The platform has also embarked on yet another campaign aimed at planting one million tree within the next five years. The Health Environment Education Poverty Eradication group campaign brings all like-minded organizations together to raise funds which would help the project to put in place nurseries, distribute tree seedlings to schools and help nurture trees in public areas. According to the CEO, a project owner could opt for the adjustable goal type campaign where one gets the money raised regardless of whether they attained the targeted amount or the fixed goal type where if the targeted amount is not accomplished, the money is refunded to the respective contributors. The platform also offers potential donors the option of conditionally pledging their contributions and honouring at a later date, say when the campaign project has managed to raise a half of its targeted amount. “Any interested entrepreneur simply needs to create a free account and launch a campaign project with a short and detailed description about their project, the amount targeted and expected launch date,” he says. Sunset at Midday Campaign Project Manager, Michael Odhiambo applauds the platform saying its worth recommending to any entrepreneur wading in financial uncertainties. “Cuberise offers the ultimate solution to seal financial void to the youths. We would not have been here without Cuberise as it has really helped us in reaching out to donors. The exposure is exceptional and worth embracing,” he says. Just like any other online business venture, Baraza says the platform is faced with the main challenge of low uptake owing to issues of trust brought about by cybercrime fears. “Cuberise has partnered with iPay, the world’s most trusted and secure payment integration service providers. The platform does not handle the cash and after the campaign period is over, a project owner only needs to request for withdrawal through iPay, and Cuberise expedites the disbursement process,” says Baraza. Asked where he wants to see Cuberise in the next few years, Baraza has his sight well-fixed on molding splendid entrepreneurs not only in Kenya but globally by leveraging on the dynamics of technology to curb the world’s major concerns of unemployment among the youth. “The World Wide Web runs the economy and without it, the world would come to a standstill. The use of ICT is no longer a luxury, whether you are a tech savvy or not, you have to embrace technology,” adds Baraza. By Rachael Kilonzo

Beaven Dhliwayo Herald Correspondent Information Communication Technology (ICT) giant, Huawei Technologies Zimbabwe, yesterday launched the National ICT Competition 2019-2020 which will provide a platform for tertiary students to compete and exchange ideas in order to enhance their ICT skills. The Chinese telecoms firm signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the country’s six universities for the first ICT competition in Zimbabwe. Huawei launched this global ICT competition in 2015, and this is the first year that Zimbabwe has joined the competition which is expected hone students’ skills, practical application skills and raise their innovation awareness. Speaking at the launch, Information Communication Technology, Postal and Courier Services Minister Dr Jenfan Muswere hailed the competition, saying it would help to develop local students’ ICT skills. “With the right skills, our people are better prepared for active citizenship, they have a better chance of finding and keeping a decent job and they are better equipped to set up their own business —and in turn, create jobs for others,” he said. “The right skills open doors to new possibilities. With the right talents in the country, our economy is poised to grow faster, creating more and better rewarding jobs.” Speaking at the same event, Huawei Technologies Zimbabwe managing director Mr Jason Shao said his company will continue to support the competition and the country’s universities to help build Huawei’s ICT talent ecosystem. “In the near future, we will also start the training to students and lecturers so that the students and academy instructors can be certified on the Huawei platform,” he said. “The Huawei ICT Academy is an important part of our ICT talent ecosystem programme. We aim to promote operations and collaboration with higher education institutions and build an international ICT talent exchange platform. “We believe that holding an influential competition for university students helps encourage better learning, teaching and development. The competition connects Huawei with the academia, connects education with ICT, and connects university students with enterprises’ talent demand.” Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Monica Mutsvangwa urged youths to seize the opportunity and help turn Zimbabwe into an ICT hub that can spur economic development. “Zimbabwe is lucky to have the Huawei ICT competition which should play a key role in the national vision of transforming the country into an upper middle income economy by 2030,” she said. “As a country, we are poised for a seamless integration spurred by the high literacy rates that the country boasts.” The Huawei ICT competition aims to enhance digital skills and encourage ICT studies among the youths by providing them with a platform to showcase their ability, compete and communicate and, eventually, drive the growth of a robust ICT talent ecosystem for innovation-driven growth and inclusive develop ment. Zimbabwe students will first battle itout locally, with winning teams advancing to the Huawei ICT competition for Southern Africa and then the global level. The Huawei ICT competition will serve as an effective platform for corporate leaders and human resources professionals to share insights, knowledge and tools with regard to ICT talent development and management in Zimbabwe. More than 28 000 students from over 14 African countries are expected to participate in the competition being held under the theme “Connection, Glory, Future”. Winning ICT students will get scholarships to study at one of China’s top technology universities.

BEIJING. – The international community is deeply shocked by what occurred in Canada – a country that claims to always stand up for human rights. A Chinese citizen transferring flights in Vancouver, Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese tech firm Huawei Technologies, was arbitrarily detained in Canada at the behest of the United States. The vile act was a serious violation of the lawful rights and interests of a Chinese citizen, triggering a tornado of criticism and creating unnecessary tensions between the two countries. In a commentary by-lined Zhong Sheng (“Voice of China”), the People’s Daily sternly condemned the act by Canada and the US, saying the detention of an individual without clear reason constitutes a flagrant violation of human rights. It said Canadian police even ignored the spirit of the law by presuming Meng Wanzhou guilty without trial, trampling on her basic human rights, and insulted her personal dignity by handcuffing and shackling her like she was some kind of notorious criminal. Canada should really reflect on what it means to be a civilized country with laws – and for that matter, a sovereign country. Canada and the United States have a special relationship and the two countries share deeply integrated economies. However, as the arrest of Meng Wanzhou shows, Canada sometimes acts more like America’s “51st state” than a sovereign country with a will of its own. Rather than frequently act like America’s trusty sidekick, Canada should exercise its sovereign right to reject the underlying anti-China bias driving the US government’s plan to crush Huawei, and instead do what is best for Canada and its important and growing relationship with China. As Canada’s second largest trading partner in agriculture and food, China is vital to the continued growth of the Canadian economy. The use of all kinds of dirty tricks to suppress Huawei has exposed some truly dark intentions toward China and its leading technology firms, but those who harbour such intentions are destined to shoot themselves in the foot. This is because every move that Huawei makes affects the world. – People’s Daily (China) Huawei, which its founder Ren Zhengfei started with just 20,000 yuan in Shenzhen some three decades ago, has grown to become one of the world’s most valuable companies, with more than 2,000 component and service suppliers, including Chinese companies such as AAC Technologies, BYD, and Foxconn, but also American companies such as Qualcomm, Intel, and Broadcom. After it was reported that Huawei’s CFO was detained by Canadian authorities, US stocks fell sharply across the board. The People’s Daily commentary warned that while China does not want to cause trouble, China is not afraid of trouble either, adding that it would be a mistake to underestimate the confidence, will, and strength of the country. After learning about Meng Wanzhou’s detention in Canada, the Chinese government lodged a protest with the Canadian side, made clear its position, and provided consular assistance to the Chinese national. On Saturday, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng summoned Canada’s Ambassador to China, John McCallum, to issue a stern warning: immediately release our citizen or bear the consequences. Then, on Sunday, the Chinese side summoned US Ambassador to China Terry Branstad to protest Meng Wenzhou’s detention by Canadian authorities at the unreasonable behest of the United States. China’s message to Canada is clear: Canada must correct its mistake and immediately stop violating her lawful rights and interests, as well as give the Chinese people a proper explanation for this disgusting and vile act made at the behest of the United States. Otherwise, as the Chinese side has warned, Canada will pay a heavy price. – People’s Daily More Stories:

OTTAWA/BEIJING. – Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of China’s telecom giant Huawei, has argued that she should be released on bail while awaiting an extradition hearing, citing fears for her health while jailed in Canada, along with other factors, according to court documents. The release of the documents on Sunday came as China’s foreign ministry summoned the United States’ ambassador to protest Meng’s arrest at Washington’s behest. It demanded the cancellation of the arrest order. The 46-year-old, who is is in custody awaiting a Canadian court’s decision on bail on Monday following her arrest on December 1 in Vancouver, faces US accusations that she misled multinational banks about Huawei’s control of a company operating in Iran. This deception put the banks at risk of violating Washington’s sanctions and incurring severe penalties, the court documents said. The arrest has infuriated Beijing, which demanded Meng’s immediate release, and stoked tensions during the trade war truce between the US and China, the world’s two largest economies. The arrest has roiled global markets as investors are worried it could torpedo attempts to thaw trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. In a sworn affidavit, Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s founding president Ren Zhengfei, said she is innocent and will contest the charges at trial in the US if she is handed over to the country by Canada. Meng said she was taken to a hospital for treatment for hypertension after being arrested. She cited hypertension as a factor in a bail application seeking her release pending an extradition hearing. She also said she has long-standing ties to Vancouver dating back at least 15 years, as well as significant property holdings in the city. Her family also sought leave to remain in Vancouver if she was granted bail, according to the court documents, with her husband saying he plans to bring the couple’s daughter to Vancouver to attend school during the proceedings. Earlier on Sunday, Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng summoned US Ambassador Terry Branstad a day after he called in Canadian envoy John McCallum to voice China’s displeasure. “Le Yucheng pointed out that the US side has seriously violated the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens, and the nature of the violation is extremely bad,” the foreign ministry said in a statement. “The Chinese side firmly opposes this and strongly urges the United States to attach great importance to China’s solemn and just position,” it said. Beijing also urged Washington to “take immediate measures to correct wrong practices, and revoke the arrest warrant against the Chinese citizen”, while warning that it would make an unspecified “further response” in light of the US actions. Al Jazeera’s Adrian Brown, reporting from Beijing, said the summoning of the US and Canada ambassadors was expected, but stressed the “muted” overall official response by the Chinese leadership. “You would anticipate in these circumstances the ambassadors of the US and Canada to be summoned to the foreign ministry … but we haven’t really heard anything from China’s leaders. “On that front, the response so far has been quite muted. I think China is leaving it to its sort of ‘attack dogs’ in state-controlled media to really do all the talking,” said Brown, citing the Global Times newspaper which has called Meng’s arrest an “act of war”. “The language is fast going to turn from purple to crimson in the days, weeks and months ahead if she remains incarcerated,” Brown added. He noted, however, that there was a shift in the online chatter about the case in recent days. “Last week, a lot of the social media posts that we were seeing were very much in favour of Meng, criticising the decision to hold her,” said Brown. “But now we see it’s starting to swing the other way; a lot of people are surprised to learn for instance that she apparently has seven passports – four from mainland China and three from Hong Kong. There are also questions over the enormity of her wealth and fact that she has two luxury properties in Vancouver.” Washington has been looking since at least 2016 into whether Huawei shipped US-origin products to Iran and other countries in violation of the country’s export and sanctions laws, the Reuters news agency reported in April. In the Canadian court documents released on Sunday, Huawei said its Iran operations were “in strict compliance with applicable laws, regulations and sanctions” of the United Nations, US and the European Union. In a company presentation from 2013 that was released with the Canadian court documents, Huawei said it communicated with the US government agencies on a “day-to-day” basis to obtain what it called “professional guidance” on trade compliance. Companies are barred from using the US financial system to funnel goods and services to sanctioned entities. Senator Marco Rubio said on Sunday he would “100 percent absolutely” introduce a measure in the new Congress that would ban Chinese telecom companies from doing business in the US. – Al Jazeera More Stories:

By Vincent Chen Chief Technology Officer at Huawei Enterprise Business Group. In the banking industry, the stable running of IT systems is imperative. This is what drove the industry to begin IT construction relatively early and what continues to drive it to make significant investments each and every year. However, the IT architecture of the banking industry, particularly the core system has stood still for decades. This year in particular, it has become clear that banks need to change their architecture. Mobile internet technologies – such as 4G and 5G and intelligent terminals are now popular. Open source technologies based on cloud computing are developing rapidly, and the banking habits of customers are changing fast. In this environment, traditional bank services from deposits and loans to remittances are quickly evolving to include payment and investment services. Meanwhile, FinTechs have used new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, cloud and big data to quickly gain a large number of customers, particularly Millennials, with enhanced business competitiveness. In China, alongside FinTech companies, internet giants such as Alibaba and Tencent already occupy a majority of customers’ portals through their own business ecosystems, including almost all payment scenarios. These enterprises also encroach on traditional financial service scenarios, posing a huge threat to traditional banks. Digital banking trend gains momentum For banks, as markets continue to become increasingly open, financial services are disintermediating, with traditional interest margins shrinking. An increasing number of newcomers to the market have also exacerbated the decline of intermediate businesses. In these circumstances, traditional banks must not become complacent. Instead, they must digitally transform. To implement digital transformation, traditional banks require new technologies to reshape businesses and upgrade core systems, reduce operation costs, improve risk control capabilities, simplify methods to acquire customers, and optimise the customer experience, as well as enter the long-tail market, which has yet to be penetrated. Meanwhile, through service transformation and the upgrade of core service systems, the lifecycle of financial products is significantly shortened, with faster service innovation required. With such transformation, banks can also integrate into or build more open banking ecosystems, transforming into a Banking-as-a-Service platform that connects various fields, including government, tourism, healthcare and transportation. This enables banking services to be accessed anytime, anywhere, creating new digital banks. It’s not the case that traditional banks are simply trying to transform into digital banks; they’re looking to build entirely new digital banks instead. FinTech companies have identified huge potential in this area of the banking market, and their aim is essentially to become technology giants with a banking license. The construction of digital banks needs a suitable market environment, which should feature adequate network and smartphone coverage, low loan coverage for small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which increases the need for digital banking platforms and FinTech with specific functions. In terms of services, the process requires scenario-based products, fast market entry, simpler interactions with customers, cooperation in the ecosystem, always-online services and strong connectivity. In terms of technology, digital banks require high performance, high scalability and high availability. They also need open source technologies, distributed architecture, a micro-service design, and a continuous integration and continuous delivery model. Unlike traditional systems, a new-look digital core banking system must be constructed using new technologies, with support for digital banking services. There are various ways to construct this new digital core in different countries and regions, and for different banks at different stages, but dual-mode architecture is the most common strategy. The mainstream architecture of bank digitisation The core systems that banks have developed over several years are supported by traditional, stable IT architecture and can’t simply be disregarded or rebuilt within a short period of time. However, banks do need new architecture to support applications and services such as mobile payments, micro-finance and e-commerce in open banking environments. Such applications can’t simply be built and tacked onto the core, stable systems of traditional banks, which are designed for deposit, loan, and remittance services. Instead, most of the new services are cloud-native applications, developed based on new technologies that are open and agile. A dual-mode architecture therefore consists of two types of architecture: stable and agile. This new type of agile architecture is generally open, distributed, or cloud-based. Chinese financial institutions have been progressing relatively fast over the last 10 years, not only as a result of the natural evolution of their own business development, but also in the face of competition from domestic internet companies. China is also arguably the most developed e-commerce market in the world. During annual shopping events, banks whether traditional or more innovative need to be able to process massive amounts of online transactions in a very short timeframe. This has driven banks to update their entire technical architecture, to support fast and elastic resource deployment, as well as quick iteration of applications. Changes in expectations regarding user experience are also driving traditional banks to quickly develop new applications, such as marketing applications (for flash sales and similar) and non-traditional financial service applications (for life and e-commerce services), with the aim of attracting new, younger customers. In this context, traditional banks need to quickly build a new digital core based on open and distributed technologies, to better support the rapid development of next generation applications, improve the customer experience and reduce the overall IT operations and maintenance cost per account. This new digital core must also support the construction of a next generation data platform, to enable banks to quickly reconstruct the data plane with big data, data lakes and data factories as well as support the rapid development and deployment of innovative banking services. Meanwhile, banks still need to maintain the stability of their traditional core, to continue to provide traditional banking services, such as processing savings and general ledgers. As these services have been running stably on traditional platforms for years, any benefits or incentives for changing these services aren’t particularly significant. So, although many banks are migrating service applications from the traditional core to a new digital core, using dual-mode architecture will continue to be the mainstream approach for many years to come. Huawei helps customers build a new digital core IT architecture is the technical foundation that supports the core banking system. For the transformation of bank IT architecture, Huawei usually explores and combines two directions: open and distributed modes. In a distributed mode, the system can be expanded quickly and horizontally, supporting large and non-linear transactions, and this is closely related to the entire architecture design. Traditional bank architecture is centralised and difficult to expand horizontally. However, x86based architecture and various open distributed technologies including the MySQL database and Hadoop are easy to expand horizontally. For example, WeBank’s Extensible Markup Language (XML) architecture. During open distributed architecture trials, many technical problems faced by the industry have been successfully resolved. Multiple large-scale practices have been implemented as a result. WeBank has been a good example of this. Other banks, such as China Minsheng Bank and MYbank, have followed suit, building new open banking system architecture based on open distributed technology. Even though the entire industry will maintain a traditional architecture (or core) for the foreseeable future, the transformation to new architecture is a trend that has now become irreversible. Since 2019, Huawei has worked in China with the banking service provider Forms Syntron to develop a solution called Fincube. This helps banks build a distributed banking digital core system that converges Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) layers. Huawei also provides the IaaS infrastructure architecture and distributed storage technology based on HUAWEI CLOUD, while the partner provides fully distributed PaaS technologies and modular digital banking systems that can flexibly adapt to various service development scenarios. Since it was launched, this solution was quickly put into commercial use by a leading bank in Thailand. The solution increases system processing capability from hundreds of transactions per second to thousands per second. Huawei has also worked closely with Chinese provider of bank software MuRong Technology to help a major Kenyan bank quickly build a new digital core system, helping it implement its inclusive financial strategy to quickly obtain customers and issue small- and micro-loans in five East African countries. Compared with traditional systems, the bank’s new digital core significantly improves transaction capacity and performance, providing intelligent data service functions such as real-time risk control through the introduction of a Huawei big data processing platform and distributed database technologies. As a global ICT solutions provider, Huawei aims to bring the solutions and best practices applied in the Chinese banking industry to more bank customers outside China. Indeed, the biggest value that Huawei can contribute to the global financial industry is its ability to replicate successful practices in China on a global scale, empowering the digital transformation and success of global financial customers.

By Nouriel Roubini, Chief Executive of Roubini Macro Associates and Professor of Economics at the Stern School of Business, New York University. NEW YORK – Last summer, my colleague Brunello Rosa and I identified ten potential downside risks that could trigger a US and global recession in 2020. Nine of them are still in play today. Many involve the United States. Trade wars with China and other countries, along with restrictions on migration, foreign direct investment, and technology transfers, could have profound implications for global supply chains, raising the threat of stagflation (slowing growth alongside rising inflation). And the risk of a US growth slowdown has become more acute now that the stimulus from the 2017 tax legislation has run its course. Meanwhile, US equity markets have remained frothy since our initial commentary. And there are added risks associated with the rise of newer forms of debt, including in many emerging markets, where much borrowing is denominated in foreign currencies. With central banks’ ability to serve as lenders of last resort increasingly constrained, illiquid financial markets are vulnerable to “flash crashes” and other disruptions. One such disruption could come from US President Donald Trump, who may be tempted to create a foreign-policy crisis (“wag the dog”) with a country like Iran. That might bolster his domestic poll numbers, but it could also trigger an oil shock. Beyond the US, the fragility of growth in debt-ridden China and some other emerging markets remains a concern, as do economic, policy, financial, and political risks in Europe. Worse, across the advanced economies, the policy toolbox for responding to a crisis remains limited. The monetary and fiscal interventions and private-sector backstops used after the 2008 financial crisis simply cannot be deployed to the same effect today. The tenth factor that we considered was the US Federal Reserve’s interest-rate policy. After hiking rates in response to the Trump administration’s pro-cyclical fiscal stimulus, the Fed reversed course in January. Looking ahead, the Fed and other major central banks are more likely to cut rates to manage various shocks to the global economy. While trade wars and potential oil spikes constitute a supply-side risk, they also threaten aggregate demand and thus consumption growth, because tariffs and higher fuel prices reduce disposable income. With so much uncertainty, companies will likely opt to reduce capital spending and investment. Under these conditions, a severe enough shock could usher in a global recession, even if central banks respond rapidly. After all, in 2007-2009, the Fed and other central banks reacted aggressively to the shocks that triggered the global financial crisis, but they did not avert the “Great Recession.” Today, the Fed is starting with a benchmark policy rate of 2.25-2.5%, compared to 5.25% in September 2007. In Europe and Japan, central banks are already in negative-rate territory, and will face limits on how much further below the zero bound they can go. And with bloated balance sheets from successive rounds of quantitative easing (QE), central banks would face similar constraints if they were to return to large-scale asset purchases. On the fiscal side, most advanced economies have even higher deficits and more public debt today than before the global financial crisis, leaving little room for stimulus spending. And, as Rosa and I argued last year, “financial-sector bailouts will be intolerable in countries with resurgent populist movements and near-insolvent governments.” Among the risks that could trigger a recession in 2020, the Sino-American trade and technology war deserves special attention. The conflict could escalate further in several ways. The Trump administration could decide to extend tariffs to the $300 billion worth of Chinese exports not yet affected. Or prohibiting Huawei and other Chinese firms from using US components could trigger a full-scale process of de-globalization, as companies scramble to secure their supply chains. Were that to happen, China would have several options for retaliating against the US, such as by closing its market to US multinationals like Apple. Under such a scenario, the shock to markets around the world would be sufficient to bring on a global crisis, regardless of what the major central banks do. With the current tensions already denting business, consumer, and investor confidence and slowing global growth, further escalation would tip the world into a recession. And, given the scale of private and public debt, another financial crisis would likely follow from that. Both Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping know that it is in their countries’ interest to avoid a global crisis, so they have an incentive to find a compromise in the next few months. Yet both sides are still ratcheting up nationalist rhetoric and pursuing tit-for-tat measures. Trump and Xi each seem to think that his country’s long-term economic and national security may depend on his not blinking in the face of a new cold war. And if they each genuinely believe the other will blink first, the risk of a ruinous clash is high indeed. It is possible that Trump and Xi will meet for talks during the G20 summit on June 28-29 in Osaka. But even if they do agree to restart negotiations, a comprehensive deal to settle their many points of contention would be a long way off. As the two sides drift further apart, the space for compromise is shrinking, and the risk of a global recession and crisis in an already fragile global economy is rising.

Mobile Telecommunications company, MTC Namibia and Huawei this week celebrated 10 years of working together. At a gala dinner held on Monday evening in celebration of the milestone, MTC and Huawei donated N$10 million to the Namibia Shack Dwellers Federations to construct 250 low cost houses countrywide. Speaking at event MTC’s Chief Human Capital and Corporate Affairs Officer, Tim Ekandjo said a house is not a privilege but a societal necessity and its provision thereof does not have to continue being a challenge. It is estimated that there are currently close to 300,000 people living in shack dwellings in the informal settlements throughout the country. At the event the H.E President Hage Geingob who was the honourable guest said, the partnership is a solid foundation of how best South-South cooperation presents fair opportunities for business. “This partnership has played a role in ensuring that people have access to the latest in mobile communication technology and ensuring that we remain at part with our global peers,” he said. Meanwhile the Managing Director of Huawei Namibia, Kian Chen, said, rooted in Namibia for more than a decade, Huawei has been proactively fulfilling its corporate social responsibility for a long-term and sustainable value creation with our partners. “We are grateful to be in this journey with MTC in facilitating the development of the local communities and result in win–win situations by enhancing ICT infrastructure with customers, nurturing an ecosystem with industrial and academic partners, bridging digital divide by cultivating ICT talent, to contribute to the goal of shared prosperity” Kian added.

On 18 August 2020, Shenzhen Metro Lines 6 and 10 were officially opened. They are the first to comprehensively apply Huawei’s Urban Rail Cloud Solution in China, as well as the first batch of metro lines with full 5G coverage in Shenzhen. They also create a record in the rail transportation industry to use artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing and big data technologies to handle various metro service systems in an intelligent Horizon Digital Platform. Line 6 of the Shenzhen Metro is 49.4km-long with 27 stations, starting at the Science Museum, then travelling through Futian, Luohu, Longhua, Guangming and Bao’an, before ending at Songgang Station. This line will not only greatly benefit public transport, but, most importantly, also benefit the development of the Guangming and Hualong Districts and will accelerate economic integration. 10 begins at Futian Port Station and passes through the central area of Futian and Meilinguan, along the central development axis to Banxuegang Science and Technology City. Line 10 is 29.31km-long, with 24 stations, and is the first line in Shenzhen that uses eight-carriage A-series trains in both northern and southern directions. It takes only 45 minutes to travel from Futian Port to Pinghu on Line 10, which relieves traffic from the Futian central area to Bantian. The line provides new access between Pinghu, Banxuegang, Huawei New City and Meilinguan East; promotes the development of the high-tech innovation area, and facilitates the construction of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Meilinguan Congestion is alleviated Line 10 will effectively alleviate long-suffered heavy congestion, particularly during peak hours, in Meilinguan. A strong focus was given to the agility of the implemented technology, allowing the operator to maintain services even under the most challenging conditions. Since planning began, Shenzhen Metro Line 10 has been entrusted with connecting the north and south of the city, sharing the pressure of existing metro lines and balancing the passenger traffic of the urban road network. Further optimisation and innovation are required in security and running efficiency to ensure that these goals can be fulfilled. To address these challenges, Shenzhen Metro adopted Huawei’s industry-leading Urban Rail Cloud Solution, where cloud computing, big data, 5G and artificial intelligence (AI) are leveraged to build a unified, open and intelligent Horizon Digital Platform for urban rail. This not only provides comprehensive support for rail operations and management but also brings a brand-new experience to the public. What is the Urban Rail Cloud, and how can Huawei’s solution be applied to Metro Lines 6 and 10? Urban Rail Cloud Currently, urban rail transit in China is continuously expanding. In many cities, metro construction spans over a long period and, when completed, lines come into operation quickly. However, the opening of a new line increases difficulties in the operation and management of the entire metro network, posing great challenges to ICT infrastructure. In a network-based environment, the service processes and operation rules need to be unified to standardise service management, thereby improving efficiency and reducing operations costs. In addition, it also requires the unified deployment of service applications and centralised data management. As for urban rail, it has become necessary to use emerging technologies to implement cloud-based and digital transformations. The Urban Rail Cloud, as the basis for smart metro construction, breaks data silos, optimises existing system architectures and provides smart metro services. Looking forward to the future On top of providing passengers with a unique Internet access experience, the 5G network can also benefit metro construction, production, operations and management. During metro construction, the 5G network can provide wireless bandwidth to support visualised management to create a more efficient, reliable and safe implementation phase. In metro operations, the Huawei AirFlash 5G Train-to-Ground Data Transfer Solution features high bandwidth and low latency, which can be used to automatically upload onboard CCTV videos and monitoring data to the Urban Rail Cloud platform for device management and timely status analysis. In these scenarios, big data analysis and AI transform status management to preventive management. China’s urban rail industry has successfully implemented cloud computing, delivering an innovative set of urban rail cloud applications. Cloud-based urban rail services have gradually evolved from a single domain to multiple ones. Customers have also increasingly realised the value of these applications. Urban Rail Cloud is being deployed and promoted in both cities with existing large-scale multi-line networks – such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Wuhan – as well as those only starting to build metro lines – for example, Hohhot and Taiyuan. Using the Urban Rail Cloud platform, Huawei’s Smart Urban Rail Solution streamlines the production, management and service subsystems of urban rails and fully integrates service data. At the same time, cloud computing and big data technologies support the rapid development of urban rail transit. To date, over 170 urban rail lines in more than 70 cities around the world have implemented the solution. In addition, Huawei actively participates in the formulation of urban rail informatisation standards in China, leads multiple standards teams and promotes urban rail cloud technologies going global.

Huawei, a leading global ICT solutions provider, has announced the 2020 edition Seeds for the Future Program known as the “Sky Seeds for the Future” despite the Covid-19 pandemic. According to Lina Cao, the Huawei Uganda Public Relations Manager the company shall carry out the program this year through online/e-learning platforms. Cao encouraged universities in Uganda to recommend their students to take advantage of the world-class training program aimed at equipping and nurturing students by exposing them to the latest industry technology trends. The Seeds for the Future program started in Uganda in 2016 and has been ongoing since then. Every year the top 10 university students in ICT-related courses are selected for a study trip in China. Approximately 30,000 students have benefited directly from this program globally since its inception. This year, however, the program is going to be different due to the effects of Covid-19 pandemic. “The Seeds for the Future will be carried out online. It’s called the Huawei Sky Seeds for the Future. Just as the previous years, we have always had several activities such as student selection, interviews, closing ceremonies, two weeks training programs in China in the latest technology, it shall continue the same way this year but online. “We are excited to add that the program this time around is open to more than 100 students. They will, among other things take part in training and exposure to 5G and cloud computing,” said Lina Cao, the Public relations Manager of Huawei Uganda. She said priority shall be given to outstanding undergraduates/graduates who have a strong interest in ICT, female students are strongly encouraged to apply and also those with vast ICT Knowledge of Huawei and understanding of China. Out of the 30 plus students who have participated in the previous four years of the program in Uganda, approximately 22 have directly benefited from Huawei internship and job opportunities availed to them. For instance, Ms Cleopatra Ajambo who participated in the 2018 Huawei Seeds for the Future program has risen from just a computer science student to an IT network architect working with Huawei Uganda. “As a Computer Science Student, you were expected to dig deep into programming as a major which was not, and is not most girls’ passion, so I found myself relying more on getting good grades than building a career as a problem solver,” says Cleopatra, whose goal for joining the Seeds for the Future competition was to travel to China for exposure. The program was launched by H.E Yoweri Museveni in 2016 and has been in partnership with the Ministry of Education and Ministry of ICT of Uganda. Related

With mobile connectivity now integral to the modern economy, a key part of any national development programme must be digital inclusion. This is being achieved by expanding mobile broadband coverage, but there is another important consideration: smartphone affordability. A recent GSMA report shows that smartphones make up 39% of the 774 million mobile connections in Sub-Saharan Africa. This is projected to grow significantly, but for Africa’s people to fully reap the dividends of mobile connectivity, it is critical that 4G-enabled smartphone handsets be made more easily attainable for the entry-level market. This calls for financial innovation alongside the technological innovation that characterises the sector. Smartphones must become cheaper if Africa is to unlock the full potential of its people. Fortunately, there are already encouraging signs that manufacturers, policymakers and network operators are partnering to integrate such financial innovation into the drive towards digital inclusion. In Kenya, Safaricom recently rolled out a device financing programme, in partnership with Google and Teleone, allowing low-income earners in Kenya to access quality 4G phones at low instalments from as little as Kshs 20 (R3) a day. The country has a high mobile telephony penetration, but this has traditionally involved 2G phones. The campaign aims to bring a million more customers into the digital economy. Airtel Africa has expanded 4G adoption on the continent with its “more for more” data offers, increasing average data use, with 4G now accounting for more than 60 per cent of its data revenue. However, one of the most effective means of encouraging smartphone adoption is reducing the tax burden on mobile phones and services in the form of import duties and sales taxes. In this context, policymakers have a powerful role to play in empowering citizens with easier access to digital connectivity. As smartphones become the norm, broadband spectrum can follow suit, and network operators can transition to a 4G- and 5G based platforms, with all the high-speed, mass-connectivity benefits that it brings. A surging demand for 4G handsets indicates when a market is ready for the 4G network transition, and it becomes possible to shut down the 3G spectrum, as India was recently able to do. At the recent LTE World Summit 2020, Sandeep Gupta, executive vice president of Barthi Airtel in India, said the decision to shut down the 3G network was motivated by two considerations – smartphone penetration, and the right network assets, such as SDR (Software Defined Radio) and singleRAN radio, which supports 4G VoLTE. However, core to this transition is affordable handsets. In China, 4G adoption has been hastened by the introduction of 100 Yuan (R238) handsets, catapulting millions into the 4G and 5G future. In South Africa, smartphones have also become significantly more affordable, with handsets such as the Huawei Y5 Lite retailing for around R1 300. However, there remains scope to make 4G-enabled smartphones even more affordable and to truly democratise connectivity. Perhaps the simplest way to hasten digital inclusion is a change in our understanding of the place of 4G handsets in our society. Once smartphones are seen as a commodity, a basic right instead of a luxury, they can be marketed, sold and taxed accordingly, bringing all of humanity into the new digital economy. Related

Huawei Corporate Senior Vice President and Director of the Board Catherine Chen telecom regulators across many nations and industries must work together to address the shared challenges that have emerged as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and create a more inclusive future for all. Chen who was delivering a keynote speech at the online Better World Summit 2020 said over the past 30 years, information technologies have advanced rapidly, making people’s lives and work much easier. “The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed though that digital infrastructure has not kept pace with technological developments,” said Chen. According to the ITU, over half of the world’s population still does not have Internet access nor access to other digital technologies. As economies across countries slow, governments grow increasingly concerned with economic recovery strategies. “We envision a more connected, intelligent, and innovative future,” said Chen. “Above all else, we must ensure this is an inclusive, sustainable, and better future by all, for all.” Other speakers at the summit included representatives from the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA), the European Competitive Telecommunications Association (ECTA), the South African Department of Communications and Digital Technologies, Thailand’s Office of the National Digital Economy and Society Commission, China’s Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), the Germany Association of the Internet Industry (ECO), and the ADL. These speakers were joined by several thousand online attendees from more than 80 countries to explore how industry policy can promote the development of the digital economy, facilitate economic recovery, and build a better future for all, by all. Top-down design; bottom-up creativity and vitality needed for economic recovery As more countries and regions successfully implement infection control measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, economic activity in certain countries has begun to return to normal. Multiple governments have launched a variety of stimulus plans, and ICT invariably has held a key place in these plans. In China, the New Infrastructure plan has set aside over 140 billion US dollars to be invested in 5G alone over the next five years. This is expected to grow China’s digital economy by more than 2 trillion US dollars and boost domestic economic recovery. The EU has also announced a 1.1-trillion-euro package to enhance economic recovery. “To revive the economy, we need top-down designs, as well as bottom-up creativity and vitality,” noted Chen. “Supporting government policies coupled with active digital transformation across the industry will bring the benefits of digital technology to all industries, boost their efficiency, and restore growth.” Seeds for the Future sows hope by leveraging ICT to enable a sustainable future Referencing the recent World Bank report on the growing gap between the fast-growing global digital economy and a lack of digital skills, Chen said Huawei is continuing with its flagship Seeds for the Future program. “This program was launched in 2008 and is designed to develop local ICT talent. So far, this program has benefited more than 30,000 students from over 400 universities in 108 countries and regions. “Due to the pandemic, we are moving the program online and opening it up to more outstanding students than ever before. As more industries adopt digital technologies, they will drive the United Nation’s 2030 Strategic Development Goals, especially those related to climate change.”

In May 2019, Huawei ignited an Information Communications Technology (ICT) Academy in Uganda to improve the number and quality of IT professions in the country. The Academy was a result of a pledge offered by Huawei to H.E Yoweri Kaguta Museveni during his visit to China, Huawei pledged to train over 1000 Uganda ICT talents through its ICT Academy at no cost for students. Since its launch, the Huawei ICT Academy has attracted thousands of enthusiasts and students with multiple accreditation points mounted at Uganda’s top Universities. Initially, Huawei signed an MOU with Makerere University as the centre of the ICT Academy, before seven more Universities joined the race to host regional Academies. Among the approved Universities, Makerere University Business School (MUBS), St Martyrs Nkozi, Kabale University, Soroti University, Muni University and Mbarara University of Science and Technology endorsed the Huawei ICT Academy certification path with a pool of over 800 students trained as Professionals. Annually, Top Talent students who excel in the Academy’s competitive professional courses tailored to prepare them for the job market, stand a chance to compete in the global Academy competitions for an all-expenses-paid trip to China, and on a lucky patch, win Internship opportunities in Huawei Uganda’s Enterprise and customer Technical divisions. Even with the Current COVID19 Pandemic, the Academy continues to certify students online with over 200 students currently undertaking different certification paths. But just like Student Success stories, Huawei Academy Instructors continue to celebrate new heights. Among the top Instructors in Uganda, John Peter Olin from Makerere University is a Huawei ICT Academy Instructor who has benefited from not only being an academy Instructor/Teacher but also improved his status as a key contributor in Uganda’s Technology ecosystem According to Olin, his journey with the Huawei ICT Academy flips back to 2018 when he joined a Boot camp hosted at Makerere University where he won an Invitation to TTT (training designed for prospective instructors of Huawei ICT Academies). With prior experience, training and practice of one vendor, sometimes the cross to another vendor is a steep one, mainly considering the change in implementation, platform and command structure. I, with some other extremely committed intelligent people managed to make it through the challenge and became Uganda’s first Huawei Certified Academy Instructors (HCAI Routing and Switching), Olin said By emerging as one of Uganda’s first-ever Huawei Certified Academy Instructors, Olin as a certified tutor embarked on a journey of unprecedented learning and training of Students at the Makerere Huawei Academy to mentor skill filled, practice-oriented, and creative minds ready to join the real-world Technology ecosystem. Through various hands-on simulator and cloud-based training in Network Engineering, Cloud Technologies, Cyber Security, among others. The Huawei ICT Academy programs empower students with top-notch ICT skills to leverage the high demand for IT Professionals in Uganda’s workforce sphere. As a certified Instructor, 70% of Olin’s all-time academy students are currently certified as Huawei routing and Switching associates. A Majority of these also work in Huawei Uganda’s technical departments putting learnt skills to immediate enterprise, service provider and technical use. Personally, I was fortunate to take more than 100 students, so far, through these training, of which more than 70% successfully passed. “Most of these start as interns, who are after a short period of time awarded contracts to work with Huawei or one of the various Huawei Partner Companies in Uganda. These include MTN, Airtel, and some special tech sensitive projects of the country,” Olin said. By garnering exposure as Interns with some of Uganda’s top Technology brands, excelling students get to know and be part of the technical architecture, design, implementation and maintenance of ICT systems. With Instructor level training capped at expert level, Olin has embarked on expanding his academy involvement by Upgrading from the base Instructor level to Professional, and currently planning to upgrade to expert level certification as he confirmed: With the Huawei ICT Academy, learning never stops, and opportunities never end. I was able to up my R & S Certification to Professional Level, by successfully self-preparing for HCIP’s 3 examinations, which I sat and passed successfully. “What’s more, I successfully passed the first and most essential exam to the Expert level certification in Routing and Switching (HCIE R&S), and now left with Lab and Interview exams, which I will take on this year,” Olin added. Furthermore, as a run-to place for equipping ICT students with top-notch skills, guidance, Internship offers and Technology centric jobs. The Huawei ICT Academy continues to groom both students and Instructors through its global academy competitions where International University scholarships, grand prizes including a USD 30,000 take home for the overall global winner are offered. Likely, Top 11 participants at the national stage and best Instructors receive numerous rewards from the competition, making the Huawei ICT Academy a must-enrol for young Technology enthusiasts in Uganda, with several Universities currently offering the academy’s top courses and resources.

The latest report from GSA shows, by the end of May 2020, 386 operators globally had announced they were investing in 5G, among which 81 operators in 42 countries/territories launched 5G commercial services, including the most recent MTN 5G launch. 5G, the fifth generation of mobile networks, will enable enhanced mobile broadband, mission-critical communications, and massive Internet of Things (IoT) communications between equipment. However, today the immediate need is for online, digital communications, which can easily be provided by 4G or LTE networks. The good news is that LTE is also the foundation for the revolutionary move to 5G. Narrowing the digital divide and empowering more of the world’s people with online connectivity is key to overcoming poverty and attaining a sustainable future. This will require constantly expanding LTE (4G) mobile broadband coverage and adoption. Living and working online is becoming acknowledged as a human right. Sadly, billions of people remain excluded from the opportunities of the online economy, according to Emmanuel Coelho Alves, Senior Marketing Director at Huawei. “There is a need to redouble our effort for more digital transmission and inclusion to support United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and bring the excluded 3.9 billion of world’s population online,” he said, “It won’t be easy, but with cross-sector efforts from government and partners in the private sector, academia and civil society … we can achieve that.” Alves was speaking at the recent online LTE Summit 2020 held by the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA). Alves said there had been progress in expanding global mobile broadband coverage, with almost 66% of areas now covered. Of these, 90% had access to high-quality networks such as 3G and 4G. Around 80% of the world’s population now has mobile coverage, according to the latest GSMA report. Of these, more than 50% of connections are already on 4G. In Sub-Saharan Africa, there are 456 million unique mobile subscribers, representing 44% of people, with this proportion expected to grow to 50% by 2025. The GSMA report predicts that Africa will be the fastest-growing global region, with a compound annual growth rate of 4.6%. However, mobile broadband subscriber numbers remain significantly lower, with 239 million subscribers and a penetration rate of just 23%. Bringing Africa’s people into the mobile economy will require ongoing expansion of mobile broadband services such as 4G, with penetration expected to reach 39% by 2025. “4G provides an extremely good asset when you go later to 5G,” said Alves. “4G has been deployed widely in the past years. 4G is the capacity layer in the city, leveraging massive MIMO (multiple-input and multiple-output) in hot spots with significant traffic.” By applying a standard known as ENDC (E-UTRAN New Radio – Dual Connectivity), network operators are able to use both 4G and 5G schedulers together. It is also possible to use a technology known as DSS (dynamic spectrum sharing) to allow for the real-time allocation of spectrum resources between 4G and 5G, depending on network traffic. This can be achieved with millisecond accuracy. “Currently, 4G is the main mobile broadband layer, and what is replacing 3G,” said Alves. “But on top of this, 4G has flexible capabilities that allow 4G and 5G to work together from the network level. Industry leaders believe that in the medium term, 4G will be the layer of choice for global mobile communications, while 5G will mainly be used in more industrial communications. However, 4G networks already have the capabilities to guarantee an optimal user experience for 5G users, including services such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and cloud gaming. It thus makes sense for national networks to invest in 4G to secure future growth opportunities, while already supporting leading-edge 5G capabilities. Mohamed Madkour, VP of global wireless networks marketing and solutions at Huawei, said at the AfricaCom 2019 conference in Cape Town last year, that “all investment in expanding 4G and organising site assets will reduce the amount of money needed to switch on 5G in the near future. Every rand spent on 4G is thus a rand invested in 5G.” Whether seen from a network operator or a policy perspective, 4G is thus not simply an interim step towards 5G. The 4G foundation already heralds the arrival of our 5G future.

The telecommunication industry in Uganda has registered tremendous growth over the past decade both in terms of increasing teledensity and expanding networks countrywide. This is due to good stewardship by the regulatory authorities and a conducive environment by Government of Uganda which has liberalized and promoted competition while attracting investment in the sector. As a result, ICT in Uganda is a vibrant industry with vital infrastructure driving economic and social transformation. According to the Uganda Communications Commission telecom market performance report 2020, the industry posted 26.7 million subscribers at the end of December 2019. The growth in Subscriptions translates into a penetration of 66 Lines per 100 i.e. 66% teledensity, of which 97% of total subscriptions remain Mobile, while 3% are fixed. In Uganda, it’s not a mobile-first strategy but a mobile-only strategy. The report further notes that at the end of December 2019, the number of active smartphones on the network had grown to 6.6 million, i.e. Smartphone penetration is under 25%. This relatively low penetration is due to slow migration from feature phones to smartphones conversion. Reflecting on the last 10 years of Airtel in Uganda I would like to share my perspective of the key trends and changes in the sector. Competition and Consolidation: Telecom sector remains highly competitive achieving the objectives of the government in a liberalized sector by driving innovation and investment through competition. The telecom industry globally is consolidating to achieve economies of scale and ability to invest top dollar in the ever-changing technologies of 2G, 3G and 4G with fibre-optic networks to enable high capacity and high-speed data networks. In Uganda, we have seen industry consolidation led by Airtel through the acquisition of Warid to build scale and a robust network. Separation and hiving of telecom towers to tower companies have unlocked precious capital for investment in wider coverage and access technology. Airtel’s sustained investment and innovation have led to a strong competitive telecom sector in Uganda, unlike the monopoly and dominance seen in Kenya, Ghana, Rwanda and many other African markets. Central region to Countrywide: It is often said 80% of Uganda’s economy is within 80 kilometres of Kampala. Economic activity and consumer concentration are highly Kampala centric. This is partly due to a delay in the development of physical and social infrastructure across all regions and districts. Airtel has played a pivotal role in expanding and modernizing the telecom networks across all 127 districts, 211 counties, 14,66 sub-county and 7,434 parishes serving nearly 97% of Uganda’s population. With high-speed internet access available across Kalangala, Kiboga, Kaberamaido, Katakwi, Kaabong, Kotido, Kanungu and Kiryandongo the urban-rural divide has been removed. Convergence – Voice to Data: The most significant change in the last decade, has been the transformation of telecom networks from voice to data, data to digital. Airtel has pioneered this initiative of achieving 100% 3G and followed up with 100% 4G LTE across all its sites. Uganda is among the few nations globally to achieve this milestone of its telecom network being fully modernized. Airtel’s investment has made it possible for “Data – the New Oil” to be available across the country. Digital transformation: The telecom industry provides critical infrastructure and connectivity to achieve digital transformation. Some of the notable digital transformations in the sector are removal and replacement of airtime scratch cards with electronic airtime. This change has removed the messy, non-biodegradable scratch cards that were polluting the environment, and ushered in a fully electronic airtime top-up solution. Registration and KYC of customers are now fully digitalised supported by an online National Identification and Registration Authority (NIRA) verification. This has made it possible for a new SIM registration or replacement to be completed within 5 minutes at any of the authorized outlets. Airtel Money has not only banked the unbanked but continues to drive financial inclusion at the bottom of the pyramid. Compliance and Culture of partnership and giving back: In the last ten years Airtel has emerged from a loss-making enterprise to a sustainably profitable one. The DNA of Airtel is one of compliance and respect of the local laws of the land. Airtel has been widely recognized for its compliance and is seen as one of the partners helping the government to achieve the objectives stated in the National Broadband Policy. Airtel’s partnership with the Buganda Kingdom and FUFA has led to the growth of the Uganda Cranes and by connecting and winning the hearts and minds of Ugandans. COVID 19 and resilience: The pandemic has impacted each and every one of us. Life priorities have been redefined with the pecking order of essential requirements food, clothing, shelter and smartphone. Airtel and other telecom networks role as an essential service provider, is clearly seen in helping with business continuity planning for the nation and protecting and powering people digitally. As a long term investor with the single largest foreign direct investment from India to Uganda, Airtel has so far invested $850 million in the development of Uganda’s ICT sector with leading-edge world-class infrastructure. Airtel Uganda has established and brought to Uganda a strong portfolio of global technology partners. These strategic partners including Mahindra Comviva, Huawei, Nokia, ZTE, Google, Facebook, ATX and Ison Technology have each contributed technological transformation of Uganda. This has helped complement the government’s initiatives in increasing broadband access and coverage across the country. The Government of Uganda launched the National Broadband Policy aimed to achieve the aspirations of the Uganda Vision 2040 by supporting the objectives of the National Development Plan (NDP II) whose theme is “Strengthening Uganda’s Competitiveness for Sustainable wealth creation, employment and inclusive growth”. The policy emphasizes the role of broadband internet in the socio-economic transformation process as a critical enabler. The policy is made a reality through Airtel’s investment and modernization program. As we celebrate 10 years in Uganda, we believe that by working together with local communities, suppliers, governments, consumers and beyond, we can transform Uganda, ready for the 4th Industrial revolution.

Huawei recently held its 5G+, Better World Summit, where various operators and industry partners shared their experiences of how 5G applications can drive significant business and industry efficiency. “5G development has entered a new phase,” said Huawei Carrier CMO Bob Cai. “With over 80 5G networks commercially available worldwide, determining how to leverage 5G to create more value is currently a topic of great interest within the industry.” “Currently, 5G for business is still more of a branding concept, and more solid work needs to be done. To build a positive business cycle, work should be done in four aspects: technology, ecosystem, standards, and business model.” 5G will drive future business Dimitris Mavrakis, research director of ABI research, highlighted that new ‘G’ technologies have historically offered major benefits to consumers. 5G, however, is likely to be most beneficial to the commercial sector. By 2030, Mavrakis predicted that 5G’s impact on the global GDP will be over $7.5 trillion – compared to the $5.1 trillion 4G contributed in 2019. “We expect that 5G will transform businesses in the same way 4G transformed consumers,” said Mavrakis. However, he cautioned that it could take several years for the manufacturing world to adopt the technology. Mavrakis also implored governments to provide opportunities for 5G to flourish within their countries and highlighted ways that this is already being done, such as in the provisioning of free 5G spectrum and the reduction in taxation of carriers. Several Huawei partners also highlighted the different industries that are already getting great benefits out of 5G. Ports of trade Xu Mengqiang, General Manager of China Mobile Ningbo, highlighted that several 5G implementations have resulted in substantial benefits to a Ningbo port. These include 5G-powered self-driving container trucks, remote-controlled cranes, and backhaul HD video streaming – which shows key cranes in real-time. The Ningbo port envisions that efficiency will be increased by over 260% while labour costs will be cut by over 70% as a result of new 5G-powered technologies. Agriculture Dr Thomas Anken is the head of the Digital Production Federal Department of Economic Affairs Education and Research in Switzerland. Anken highlighted that 5G is enabling a variety of smart farming methods that have a significant impact on the yields of farms in the country. Examples include: Multispectral imaging of wheat fields by drones resulting in a 10% decrease in fertiliser usage. Tractors with an automated hoe that recognises plants and eliminates the weeds around them. The swift delivery of important intelligence to the cloud which ensures that automated robots receive data to update their machine learning capabilities, while farmers also receive insights into how they can optimise their processes. Smart factories Guo Lihong, Deputy Director of the Engineering Equipment Department of Hunan Valin Xiangtan Iron and Steel, explained that 5G is expected to increase the factory’s efficiency by 30% while reducing costs by the same margin. 5G is used with remote-controlled cranes and slag-adding arms to streamline the factory’s processes, and these cranes have improved production efficiency by 33%. The ability for production line surveyors to watch real-time production through HD video has also optimised these workers’ jobs. In total, the factory plans to build 100 5G macro sites as well as three management centres to continue to reap the benefits of 5G. Hospitals Hospitals in the Henan province have implemented a variety of impressive 5G-powered functionalities to improve their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These systems were installed within 82 hours and involved the building of remote systems for 147 hospitals in 18 cities within the province. Features that were available to these hospitals included: Remote surgery guidance. Robots through which doctors can talk to patients. Systems in ambulances which support first response teams – in an ambulance moving at 80km/h, backhaul speed is 50MB/s. Related

Digital technology plays an important role in education. However, 50% of the world’s population still does not have Internet access, and many people lack the skills needed to use digital devices. As a result, the digital divide in education continues to widen. According to Huawei’s Deputy Chairman Ken Hu, they believe that everyone everywhere has the right to education and the equality of opportunity it brings. “As a technology company, Huawei wants to help with connectivity, applications and skills by focusing on two important areas of connecting schools and developing digital skills respectively,” says Ken Hu. In terms of connecting schools, Huawei will help to provide access to high-quality educational resources such as digital curriculums and e-learning applications, and teacher and student training by connecting school to the Internet with partners. In South Africa, Huawei recently launched the DigiSchool project in partnership with operator Rain and educational non-profit organization Click Foundation, aiming to connect 100 urban and rural primary schools over the next year, in addition to the 12 already connected through 5G technology. “Through digital education, we not only address the literacy crisis in the country but also provide young children with the digital skills needed for future success,” Nicola Harris, CEO, Click Foundation added at the webinar. This was during a Webinar where Ken Hu outlined Huawei’s vision and action plan for education under its digital inclusion initiative TECH4ALL at the Global Education Webinar entitled “Driving Equity and Quality with Technology”, emphasizing that “connecting schools and skills development are two key ways for Huawei to improve equitable and quality education.” The webinar was joined by leaders and experts from UNESCO, GSMA, the Ministry of National Education of Senegal, universities and educational institutions, as well as the private sector. Improving Equitable and Quality in Education through Technology In terms of digital skills development, Huawei plans to provide digital skills training for vulnerable groups in remote areas, especially female students, through projects such as DigiTruck in a program called ‘Skills on Wheels.’ Since the launch of DigiTruck in Kenya at the end of last year, it has provided training for more than 1,500 young adults and teachers in rural areas. Huawei hopes to replicate the program in France, the Philippines and other countries in the next two years. “These all solar-powered, mobile classrooms with wireless broadband access can reach even the most remote communities.” Olivier Vanden Eynde, CEO of Close the Gap, key partner of DigiTruck, said. Stepping up efforts in response to Covid-19 Huawei has stepped up its efforts through its TECH4ALL initiative in support of UNESCO’s Global Education Coalition, set up to tackle the global challenges impacting education due to the Covid-19 pandemic. For instance, the company has joined forces with the UNESCO Coalition and the Ministry of National Education of Senegal to support the country to carry out distance learning during the outbreak. Local teachers are provided with connectivity, digital devices and skills training which will benefit more than 100,000 students. “This crisis has changed the face and future of education. It has demonstrated how fast change can happen through partnership, when expertise and resources are matched up with local needs to ensure learning continuity, especially for the most marginalized students,” said Stefania Giannini, UNESCO Assistant Director-General for Education. At the same time, the Huawei ICT Academy launched its “Learn ON” program in early April, aiming to address the educational needs of University-based ICT talent affected by the epidemic. The program brings together global university partners and offers college cooperation incentive funds, which can be used for online courses and examinations, online experiments, etc., and provides more than 130 Massively Open Online Courses (MOOC) resources, covering cutting-edge technology fields such as artificial intelligence, big data, 5G, and the Internet of Things. Public-private cooperation accelerating the resolution of education issues The Global Education Webinar focused on the two topics of “Distance Learning for Better Education Continuity” and “ICT Innovation for Inclusive Learning”. The best practices and experience of China, France, Luxembourg, Senegal, South Africa and other countries were shared and discussed and Borhene Chakroun, Director of UNESCO’s Policy and Lifelong Learning Systems, reiterated that “with at least 63 million primary and secondary teachers affected, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for developing teachers’ capacity to effectively engage in distance learning, which will become part of the education and training provision in the future”. In addition, participants reached a consensus that public-private cooperation is the key to promoting inclusive education by digital technology. “Many lessons have been learnt this year in low- and middle-income countries, adapting services to address the needs of users and responding to the impact of the global pandemic by evolving business and critical partnerships. The GSMA and the mobile industry are supporting the current situation and committed to long-term support of the SDGs (the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal) in the era of ethical leadership.” added by Stephanie Lynch-Habib, Chief Marketing Officer, GSMA. To achieve greater digital inclusion in the education field, it requires cross-sector efforts by governments, industry organizations, educational institutions, and technology companies to contribute their respective experiences and resources. This will ultimately accelerate the achievement of SDG 4 (“Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”) by 2030.

As the world commemorated the 2020 International Day of Family Remittances (IDFR) on June 16 in this game-changing year, it is important to draw attention to the millions of migrant workers globally who play a vital role in global economies says the UN. Countries around the world went to battle with a novel virus that emerged late in 2019 in order to save millions of lives, enforcing strict stay-at-home measures to curb the virus’s spread. As a result, economies globally came to a complete or a near-complete standstill. This will have directly impacted the more than 200 million migrant workers who support their 800 million family members back in their home countries (United Nations, 2020). In April, the World Bank predicted the sharpest decline of remittances in recent history. Global remittances were projected to decline sharply by about 20 per cent in 2020 due to the economic crisis induced by the COVID-19 pandemic and shutdown. Remittance flows to Sub-Saharan Africa are expected to decline by 23.1 per cent to reach $37 billion in 2020, while recovery of 4 per cent is expected in 2021. For those families depending on remittances to fund their basic living costs, the risk of falling below the poverty line has increased substantially. Cashless transaction This illustrates Huawei’s position that Digital Financial Services (DFS) offers a new means for people, government and businesses to transact in a cashless way. “With the pandemic forcing people to socially distance themselves from others, the adoption of DFS has been increasing across countries like Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa. “In Kenya where mobile money has already made great inroads, the government has actively promoted cashless transactions as a means to limit contact spread of the virus,” says Edison Xie, Director of Media Affairs, Huawei Southern Africa Region. A MasterCard global consumer study conducted in April 2020 indicated that 75 per cent of South African consumers were using contactless payments with 88 per cent of the South African respondents viewing contactless as a cleaner as well as a faster way to pay and to limit the amount of time spent in stores. Estimates for DFS adoption globally may be as high as 67 per cent post-pandemic adjusted 5-10 per cent upwards from pre-pandemic estimates of 57% (Forbes Africa, 2020). Yet for the most marginalised and vulnerable in our economies and in society, some barriers remain that prevent more widespread adoption and use of DSF for remittances. High cost ”The most expensive corridors are observed mainly in the Southern African region, with costs as high as 20 per cent. At the other end of the spectrum, the less expensive corridors had average costs of less than 3.6 per cent,” says Xie. The World Bank estimated a cost of around 6.7 per cent on a remittance value of $200 but for Sub Saharan Africa, this cost rose to 9 per cent even though intra-regional migrants in Sub-Saharan Africa comprised over two-thirds of all international migration from the region. The United Nations estimated that between US$200-300 was spent on the costs of transfers (United Nations, 2020). Xie says that the major contributor to the high costs of remittances is the costly operations of cross border money operators handling cash transfers. “Reducing the reliance on cash transfers and currency exchanges is thus an important way to reduce remittance costs for those sending money to Sub Saharan countries. Digital money transfer options become essential to facilitating lower costs remittances for migrant workers,” he said. As DFS adoption increases and the ecosystem expands to bring in more services suited to the market it serves, the evolution of the platforms coupled with increased support from the government in the form of consumer protection, costs of remittances can be expected to gradually reduce. Digital Divide Digital Financial Services allows for a multitude of benefits to be realised for countries and their people. Greater control of funds (how they flow and who they reach), improved accountability in systems and the ability of recipients of funds digitally to better manage resources for their own development. It is important, however, for the full digital financial services ecosystem and value chain to be considered when initiatives are undertaken to improve participation rates. DFS and remittances will thrive when the basics are in place to ensure every citizen in a country has equal access to the tools to participate in this part of the digital economy. Access to Broadband connectivity, access to smartphones to access digital financial and other services, access to affordable data, relevant content and the ability to understand and use these services are all essential precursors to a fully participative population. It is therefore crucial for governments across the continent to put their full might behind addressing the digital divide; firstly with widespread, quality Broadband access to all and then reducing barriers to accessing the Internet and digital services with speed. “Let us use this International Remittance Day to take stock of where we are as countries responding to our people’s needs for services to improve the quality of their lives, in particular financial services,” says Xie.

Huawei Executive Meng Wanzhou has accused the United States of providing a “grossly inaccurate [and] misleading” summary of evidence to the Canadian court hearing her extradition case, arguing that the case should be thrown out as a result. The new claims in Meng’s bid to avoid extradition to the US to face fraud charges include that the US misrepresented and omitted details of a crucial PowerPoint presentation that Meng delivered to an HSBC banker in Hong Kong. The 2013 presentation forms the basis of the US claims that she defrauded HSBC by lying about Huawei’s business in Iran, allegedly in breach of US sanctions and that she should be sent to New York to face trial. “Ms Meng will submit that the Requesting State’s summary of evidence … is grossly inaccurate and based on deliberate and/or reckless misstatements of fact and material omissions, thereby constituting a serious abuse of the extradition process that should disentitle the Requesting State to proceed,” her lawyers said in a memo, released on Monday by the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Meng was arrested by Canadian police, acting on a US request, at Vancouver’s airport on December 1, 2018, throwing China’s relations with Canada and the US into turmoil. The new claims also allege that the US falsely asserted that only junior HSBC employees were aware of the nature of Huawei’s relationship with Skycom, a company in Iran that the US says conducted business there on behalf of Huawei. “Evidence will demonstrate that it is inconceivable that any decision to modify or terminate HSBC’s relationship with Skycom or Huawei would not have been reviewed by the most senior management of HSBC,” said the memo. The memo, dated Friday, was made public after a hearing in Vancouver to discuss the management of Meng’s sprawling extradition case, which has been thrown into disarray by the Covid-19 pandemic. Meng’s team submitted a schedule that would see hearings last until at least May 25, 2021, while the Canadian government lawyers representing US interests in the case proposed hearings until March 26. Appeals could ultimately stretch the case out for years. But Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes did not endorse either schedule and questioned the order that both sides wanted various arguments addressed. As a result, the hearing was adjourned until June 23, with Meng – who is Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of the company founder, Ren Zhengfei – bound over until then. Meng and both sets of lawyers attended Monday’s hearing by phone, as part of the court’s Covid-19 precautions. In the memo, Meng’s lawyers also take issue with “false statements” in the US record of the case that “as a result of [Meng’s] misrepresentations, HSBC extended US$900 million of credit to Huawei”. “In fact, there never was a US$900 million credit facility between Huawei and HSBC,” the memo says. Instead, it says, HSBC and eight other banks jointly provided HSBC with a US$1.6 billion credit facility, of which HSBC’s contribution was US$80 billion. The claims about misrepresentation in the US record and supplemental record of the case – summaries of evidence provided to the court – represent a new third branch of an abuse-of-process argument by Meng’s lawyers. The other two branches are that Meng was unlawfully searched and interrogated by Canadian border officers at Vancouver’s airport at the behest of the US FBI before she was formally arrested and that the case is a matter of political abuse, highlighted by US President Donald Trump’s comments on it. “This is a very unusual extradition case. It has been described as unique,” said one of Meng’s lawyers, Richard Peck, at Monday’s hearing. “It does give rise to three arguments on abuse … [one] in relation to the president of the requesting state and his assertion that he would effectively do what he wanted with Ms Meng, which we consider to be an outrageous comment.” That was a reference to comments made by Trump on December 11, 2018, when he told Reuters news agency that he would intervene in Meng’s case if it was in the interests of US national security or it helped the US seal a trade deal with China. “Whatever’s good for this country, I would do … If I think it’s good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made – which is a very important thing – what’s good for national security – I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,” Trump said. Meng’s lawyers have seized on those comments as proof that the case against Meng is politically inspired. As part of the other plank of the abuse claim, Meng’s lawyers have described a report written by Canada’s Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) on the morning before her arrest, which they say provides evidence of “coordinated state misconduct” between the US and Canada against her. The spy agency’s report predicted the impending detention would “send shock waves around the world”, and stated that “advanced communication to the CSIS came from the FBI”. The report’s existence was made public last week. According to Chinese state news agency Xinhua, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Monday that the CSIS report “shows once again that the whole Meng Wanzhou case is a serious political incident. It speaks volumes about the US political calculations to purposefully suppress Huawei and other Chinese hi-tech companies.” Meng’s arrest more than 18 months ago triggered a crisis in Chinese relations with the US and Canada. China arrested Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig and accused them of espionage, moves that are widely believed in Canada to represent retaliation and hostage-taking. Meng, 48, is living under partial house arrest in Vancouver on C$10 million (US$7.36 million) bail. Related

Bankers from Sub Saharan Africa and China who attended the Huawei Sub-Saharan Africa Financial Services Industry Online Summit 2020 agree that digitisation of the sector will give it resilience against the current Covid-19 pandemic and enable sustained growth in the post COVID era. The pan-African conference themed “Accelerating Digital Transformation, Enable Business Growth Again” was attended by 1200 delegates from across banks, telco operators, fintech and ICT services companies. Opening the event, Liao Yong, vice president of Huawei Southern Africa Region, said advances in ICT present unique opportunities for the banking sector, especially when almost 70% of the region’s population don’t have a bank account. “All of these ICT advances will be critical enablers to a thriving banking sector in Sub Saharan Africa. As we can see, the merging of these two curves of ICT and banking services is powerful. “But how much we can unleash the power, depends on how much and how soon the banking sector goes digital,” Liao said. There has been a rapid uptake of mobile technologies in the region with strong economic growth in the past 2 decades. According to statistics by GSMA, 4G, mobile broadband technology, adoption will overtake 2G in 2023 and the total of unique subscribers in Sub Saharan Africa will reach 600 million by 2025, representing half the region’s population. Speaking at the online event, Brett King, author of Bank 4.0, a New York-based mobile banking startup, said the behavioural changes that come with coronavirus further underpins the needs for digital transformation in the banking sector. “The declining use of physical branches is likely for many customers to remain a permanent feature of their lives. The reality is this is likely to accelerate a multi-decade trend we’ve already seen towards digitisation. “So when we look at the architecture of banking moving forward and the real elements that have been accelerated during the coronavirus period, you can see that that shift to digital is creating much more aligned, some digital experience. “This basically brings us to a new model of banking…we moved to this low friction banking embedded in the world around us,” said King. In China, bucking the decline in Q1 GDP, the financial sector recorded a 6% year-on-year growth. Analysts attribute this growing to the sector’s years of unremitting efforts in digital transformation. Chen Kunte, former Chief Information Officer of China Merchants Bank and current Chief Digital Transformation Officer of Global Financial Services in Huawei’s Enterprise Business Group said digitisation will give the banking sector the resilience it needs in the public health crisis. Banking everywhere can’t come true without leveraging cloud, AI and Big Data. “We need to restructure banks’ ICT platforms from legacy architecture to cloud-based, open architecture by building AI-Powered and Data-Driven platforms to expand the way financial institutions engage and interact with their customers, and accommodate more innovative business models and service scenarios,” Chen said. Banks from the region shared some case studies on digitisation in banking services in the region. Lucille De Kock, Head of Data Analysis and Product Management at FNB, South Africa, introduced FNB’s fundamental shifts across all dimensions to transform the bank into a helpful, trusted and people-centric money manager leveraging digital and data platforms. According to Alex Siboe Wekunda, head of DFS, KCB, said 97% of all transactions are done digitally which lead to substantial growth during the pandemic. Luckily enough, we had invested well in our platform, so we’re able to handle the traffic that comes through this ecosystem. And Joshua Oigara, CEO and MD, KCB Group PLC, said KCB will continue to accelerate that investment beyond the just lending platform, which has been very successful. Huawei works with over 1,000 financial institutions globally, including 6 of the world’s top 10 banks in the digital transformation voyage. Liao concluded, “Our operations of over 20 years in Sub Saharan Africa enables us to think global and act locally by providing our clients in the region with tailored-made solutions to make digitisation process painless and smooth as if it is a tech company that happens to work in the financial sector rather than as a bank that tries to adopt disruptive technologies.” Related

Since the introduction of the World Wide Web (www) in the early 1990s, Information Communications Technology (ICT) has been dominated by men worldwide. Today, ICT is the backbone driving the prosperity of nations and organization, inspiring a better living for people across the globe. However, no development is one-sided if it leaves out the participation of all gender. And increased women participation in the Technology ecosystem in this decade can be inspired by Innovation-driven startups and Enrollment for ICT education. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in 2011 marked the last Thursday of April as a day dedicated to celebrating girls in ICT worldwide. Over 9,000 celebrations attracted 300,000 women participants by 2018, and today we celebrate the Women that have broad passion for Technology and continue growing while excelling in ICT. In Uganda, the rate of Women owning Internet-enabled devices like Smartphones and Personal Computers (PCs) has risen by 40% since 2015 as per social media analytics results. This is attributed to the dropping of prices for devices, Internet and to greater extent access to quality digital skilling (ICT education) as well as Innovation competitions and initiatives. As a Tech company, we attached great importance to skilling and empowering women in ICT through our various skilling initiatives which include the Huawei Seeds for the future, the Huawei ICT competition and Huawei ICT Academy as well as offering employment. We take pride in seeing women prosper and flourish in ICT through our several initiatives. I would like to bring to your attention a great success and inspirational story of a woman who has grown with our company in a space of one year from just an intern to a team leader and to a manager. Ms Cleopatra Ajambo participated in the 2018 Huawei Seeds for the Future program that involves top college students in ICT-related departments for a two weeks study trip in China. Over 3,000 students globally have taken part in this programme. It’s through the competition that Cleopatra changed her life from just a Computer Science Student to an IT networks architect working with Huawei Uganda. “As a Computer Science Student, you were expected to dig deep into programming as a major which was not, and is not most girls’ passion, so I found myself relying more on getting good grades than building a career as a problem solver,” says Cleoptra, whose goal for joining the Seeds for the Future Competition was to travel to China for exposure. Amidst stiff competition, Cleopatra qualified for the national round after drafting a project proposal on how ICT can be leveraged to help people with chronic diseases remotely get access to doctors by using their smartphones. She wrote a proposal addressing people having chronic diseases and through the use of gadgets and networks, their health would be actively monitored remotely by the doctors. Cleopatra’s dream to visit China became a reality opening up her doors to a brighter career in the ICT Industry. On return, she was offered an Internship opportunity at Huawei Uganda to further enhance her career. Due to her growing passion for ICT, she progressed through various ranks to her current position as a Maintenance Manager in less than two years. She joined Huawei as an intern without any network skills but going through several pieces of training and documentation reading, she moved from being an intern of a survey, to an IP engineer configuring devices such as cameras, switches, routers, firewall, to a maintenance manager where she coordinated the fibre team, networks team, and the systems team.” In the light of the Huawei ICT Academy at Makerere University that opened doors for Cleopatra to join the annual skills competition, and enrich her career path, we believe increased ICT education in Uganda has attracted Women to enhance their skills, and win positions that were previously known to be dominated by Men. “Being in a field mostly dominated by men, what motivates us to always be outstanding. I am very competitive while at work, I am personally interested in computer networking, Routing and switching, certified in HCIA (Huawei Associate) and currently pursuing HCIP (Huawei computer internetworking professional),” Cleopatra explains her motivation. Among the successful women in Uganda leveraging ICT to lead and solve real-life problems in previously men dominated positions include the Minister of ICT and National Guidance Ms Judith Nabakooba, the recently appointed UCC Executive Director Ms Irene Sewakambo Kaggwa, among others. As Women continue to rise in the ICT Industry, the role of ICT companies and Government support to nurture girls through quality ICT education and skill competitions respectively will bring a fair balance in an industry that was once known to be dominated by men. Happy International Women in ICT Day. Article Written By Huawei Uganda Managing Director Liujiawei Related

At the Industrial Digital Transformation Conference-Live, Huawei officially released the Huawei ICT Academy Program 2.0. Through this program, Huawei aims to develop 2 million ICT professionals and popularize digital skills over the next five years by collaborating with universities. This is part of Huawei’s digital inclusion initiative, TECH4ALL, which is intended to expand the benefits of digital technology to everyone, everywhere. Huawei will set up the Huawei ICT Academy Development Incentive Fund (ADIF), with a total investment of at least US$50 million over the next five years. 2013 saw the establishment of the Huawei ICT Academy program, under which Huawei has provided quality courses and support services to universities/colleges to help them train teachers, establish and optimize ICT majors, improve the curriculum system, and build standard labs. Huawei ICT Academy also introduces Huawei’s ICT technologies and products to students in universities around the world, encourages them to participate in Huawei certification, and develops an innovative and application-oriented technical talent for society and the global ICT industry. Since 2015, Huawei has partnered with more than 600 international universities to set up Huawei ICT academies, helping the universities improve their ICT teaching abilities and train more than 1500 teachers. To meet new requirements and challenges, the Huawei ICT Academy Program will enter the 2.0 phase in 2020. According to its five-year plan, Huawei will develop 2 million ICT professionals and continuously update its school-enterprise cooperation solutions in cutting-edge technologies, such as 5G and Artificial Intelligence (AI). To achieve this goal, Huawei will set up the Huawei ICT Academy Development Incentive Fund (ADIF), with a total investment of at least US$50 million over the next five years. This fund aims to help ICT academies operate stably by the following four actions: Providing teaching experiment equipment for cooperative universities to improve students’ practical skills. Training teachers through ADIF, providing free exam vouchers to encourage students to take Huawei’s certification exams and setting up an education fund to reward excellent teachers and students. Holding the Huawei ICT Competition to provide a platform for students to communicate with their peers and show their talents. Cooperating with partners on ICT Talent Job Fairs to help students find jobs and promote efficient matching between talent supply and demand. Hank Stokbroekx, Vice President of Enterprise Service, Huawei Enterprise BG, said that Huawei will continue to establish more ICT Academies. “Every year, we will build 600-1000 Huawei ICT Academies. By doing so, we aim to benefit more university teachers and students in the digital world, enable more people to enjoy equal and high-quality education, enhance digital skills, and inject fresh impetus into the industry,” said Stokbroekx. The launch of Huawei ICT Academy Program 2.0 marks a new stage of Huawei’s talent ecosystem development. In the future, Huawei will deepen cooperation with all parties in the ecosystem, increase investment, and accelerate the construction of an all-round, full-cycle sustainable talent ecosystem to fuel the digital transformation of industries.

At the Huawei product and solution launch in London, Ryan Ding, Executive Director of the Board and President of Huawei’s Carrier BG, delivered a keynote titled “5G, Bring New Value”. He released Huawei’s new 5G products and solutions and launched the 5G Partner Innovation Program. These efforts aim to build a thriving 5G ecosystem and make 5G a commercial success. “ 5G has developed beyond imagination in terms of deployment, ecosystem, and experience and networks are the foundation for the 5G business,” said Ding. So far, Huawei has been awarded 91 commercial 5G contracts and shipped over 600,000 5G Massive MIMO Active Antenna Units (AAUs). As a leading global 5G supplier, Huawei is committed to developing the best end-to-end 5G solutions. These will include the industry’s highest-performance 5G base station that supports all scenarios and the Blade AAU with the industry’s highest level of integration. The Blade AAU can work under all sub-6 GHz frequency bands and support 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G networks. This addresses the issue of limited space for antenna installation and reduces the total cost of ownership (TCO) by over 30% when compared to existing solutions. Huawei is also the first vendor in the industry to provide industrial 5G modules for vertical applications. With 4G, people can share their videos and voices. However, with the ultra-high bandwidth offered by 5G, people will be able to enjoy immersive AR and VR experiences, allowing them to convey their thoughts and feelings like never before. These amazing experiences will create incredible new value. As 5G enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) matures, high-definition video services will drive the massive growth of 5G B2C services. 5G B2B services have also shown huge potential. Huawei and some operators have jointly released 5G white papers and explored B2B applications in order to drive 5G application in numerous industries. At the launch event, Ryan Ding showed the audience Huawei’s recently-released live broadcast backpack. This backpack, embedded with a 5G module, makes live broadcasting far easier. Ding emphasized that in the 4G era, virtually all operators provided the same network experience. However, in the 5G era, operators can provide differentiated experiences and charge users based on more metrics, including data volume, latency, bandwidth, and a number of devices connected. This makes it possible to monetize 5G. It is critical that operators redefine their 5G business models now. Huawei and its global partners have worked together on multiple 5G projects, covering many domains including new media, campus, healthcare, and education. At the event, Ryan Ding launched the 5G Partner Innovation Program, witnessed by many of Huawei’s industry partners. Through this program, Huawei plans to invest US$20 million into innovative 5G applications over the next 5 years, contributing to a thriving 5G ecosystem and accelerating the commercial success of 5G.

Neither the European public nor European political and business leaders fully understand the threat presented by Xi Jinping’s China. Although Xi is a dictator who is using cutting-edge technology in an effort to impose total control on Chinese society, Europeans regard China primarily as an important business partner. They fail to appreciate that since Xi became President and General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC), he has established a regime whose guiding principles are diametrically opposed to the values on which the European Union was founded. The rush to embrace Xi is greater in Britain, which is in the process of separating itself from the EU, than in the EU itself. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to distance the United Kingdom from the EU as much as possible and to build a free-market economy that is unconstrained by EU regulations. He is unlikely to succeed because the EU is prepared to take countermeasures against the type of deregulation that Johnson’s government seems to have in mind. But in the meantime, Britain is eyeing China as a potential partner, in the hope of re-establishing the partnership that former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne was building between 2010 and 2016. The Trump administration, as distinct from US President Donald Trump personally, has done much better in managing its ties with China. It developed a bipartisan policy that declared China to be a strategic rival and put tech giant Huawei and several other Chinese companies on the so-called Entity List, which forbids US companies to trade with them without government permission. Only one person can violate this rule with impunity: Trump himself. Unfortunately, he appears to be doing just that by putting Huawei on the bargaining table with Xi. Since May 2019, when the United States placed it on the Entity List, the Department of Commerce has granted Huawei several three-month exemptions in order to prevent undue hardship for the company’s US components suppliers. Huawei is a very unusual – and in some ways unique – company. Its founder, Ren Zhengfei, received his technical education in part as a member of the People’s Liberation Army engineering corps, and the PLA became one of his first major customers. At the time of Huawei’s founding in 1987, all of China’s technology was imported from abroad, and Ren’s goal was to reverse engineer foreign technologies with local researchers. He has succeeded beyond his wildest dreams. By 1993, Huawei launched the most powerful telephone switch available in China. Subsequently, it received a key contract from the PLA to build the first national telecommunications network. It then benefited from the government’s policy, adopted in 1996, for nurturing domestic telecommunications manufacturers, which also meant keeping foreign competitors out. By 2005 Huawei’s exports exceeded its domestic sales. In 2010, Huawei was included in Fortune magazine’s global list of the 500 largest companies. After Xi came to power, Huawei lost whatever autonomy it may have enjoyed. Like every other Chinese company, it must follow the CPC’s orders. Until 2017, this remained an implicit understanding; with the adoption of the National Intelligence Law that year, it became a formal obligation. Soon after that, a Huawei employee was involved in a spying scandal in Poland, and the company has also been accused of other cases of espionage. But spying is not the greatest danger for Europe. Making Europe’s most critical infrastructure dependent on Chinese technology means opening the door to blackmail and sabotage. It is clear to me that under Xi, China poses a threat to the values on which the EU was founded. Apparently, this is not clear to the leaders of EU member states, nor to the leaders of the industry, particularly in Germany. The EU faces a tremendous challenge: the silent pro-European majority has spoken, saying that their primary concern is climate change, but the member states are fighting with one another over the budget and are more focused on appeasing Xi than with maintaining the transatlantic relationship. Instead of fighting a losing battle against Huawei’s dominance in the 5G market, the US and the EU, or the EU alone, ought to cooperate in building up Ericsson and Nokia as viable competitors. Xi will meet the heads of state and government of the 27 EU member states at the EU-China summit in Leipzig in September. Europeans need to understand that this will hand him a much-needed political victory unless he is held accountable for, and questioned about, his failure to uphold human rights, particularly in Tibet, Xinjiang, and Hong Kong. Only the Chinese political leadership can decide Xi’s future. The harm caused by his mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak has become so visible that the Chinese public, and even the Politburo, must recognize it. The EU should not knowingly facilitate his political survival.

US carrier Verizon has been served with a lawsuit from Chinese networking giant Huawei Technologies, over alleged unauthorized patent use. Huawei alleges that American carrier used 12 of its patents without authorization, and it is seeking compensation, as well as ongoing royalty payments. The patents cover a number of technologies including computer networking, download security and video communications. None of the patents involves 5G technologies. Patent usage The lawsuit was filed with the Eastern and Western District courts in Texas, Reuters reported, which also stated that Verizon has previously declined to comment on its patent dispute with Huawei. “Verizon’s products and services have benefited from patented technology that Huawei developed over many years of research and development,” Huawei’s Chief Legal Office was reported by Reuters as saying in a statement. “Huawei is simply asking that Verizon respect Huawei’s investment in research and development by either paying for the use of our patents or refraining from using them in its products and services.” Huawei could not provide a figure on the compensation as it does not have a breakdown of the patents’ alleged contribution to Verizon’s services, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. In the court documents, Huawei alleged that Verizon “profited greatly” from its technology. It seems that both Huawei and Verizon held six face-to-face meetings over the matter since February last year but did not reach an agreement, the person told Reuters. He or she is not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and so declined to be identified. In June, the Wall Street Journal reported that Huawei was seeking compensation from Verizon for the use of more than 200 of its patents. The Chinese company apparently decided to take action for 12 patents because it considered evidence for them was clearest and that the number was manageable for the court, the person told Reuters. US government In March 2019, Huawei sued the US government over a ban on the use of its telecoms products, in an effort to push back against what it says are baseless US allegations against the firm. It had filed the lawsuit in the US district court in Plano, Texas, the Dallas suburb where its US headquarters are located, targeting a 2018 measure that bans US government agencies from buying Huawei equipment. Huawei and ZTE have long been declared a national security threat in the US, and Huawei, which is the second-largest smartphone maker after Samsung, is effectively barred from selling its handsets in the country.

Huawei overtook Apple to become the second-biggest smartphone maker of 2019, in spite of formidable trade barriers. Huawei was second only to Samsung in full-year 2019 sales, with Apple coming in third, said Counterpoint Research. It’s the first time the Shenzhen, China-based telecommunications equipment giant has beaten Apple in full-year sales. The gains came in spite of the US’ move in May of last year to place Huawei on its national security “entity list”, which means newer Huawei phones can’t offer Google services or access to the Play Store. Sales ban The ban also affects Huawei’s ability to purchase other software, hardware and services made in the US. The lack of Google services sharply limits the Huawei devices’ appeal outside of China. However, China alone made up 60 per cent of Huawei’s revenues, and a strong marketing push helped the company gain nearly 40 per cent market share in the country. In 2017 Huawei overtook Apple in sales for the months of June and July, and it also outsold Apple in the second quarter of 2018, but this is the first time it has beaten the iPhone maker on full-year sales. Prior to the entity list ban, Huawei had been expected to challenge Samsung for the top spot last year, according to Strategy Analytics. Strong Apple sales Apple was, however, the top smartphone seller in the fourth quarter, beating out both Samsung and Huawei, driven by the iPhone 11’s lower pricing. Samsung maintained its top spot for the year, with Xiaomi and Oppo rounding out the top five, analysts said. The coming year sees ongoing political and economic uncertainties, including the threat to supply chains posed by the current coronavirus outbreak, Counterpoint noted. “2020 will likely see efforts to further diversify investments across geographies to mitigate risks,” said Counterpoint analyst Tarun Pathak. 5G on the way The company noted that the emergence of 5G last year allowed smartphone makers to gain attention by releasing industry-first 5G-capable devices. It predicted 5G smartphones would grow to account for around 18 per cent of total global smartphone shipments this year, up from 1 per cent in 2019. Counterpoint noted that the smartphone market is gradually consolidating, with the top five manufacturers holding 66 per cent of the market, compared to 65 per cent in 2018 and 62 per cent in 2017. Counterpoint and Strategy Analytics both found that total smartphone sales for 2019 declined by about 1 per cent. But Counterpoint noted that the decline was lower than the 4 per cent sales drop in 2018, and noted that the fourth quarter of 2019 actually saw a sales increase of 3 per cent year-on-year, possibly indicating a market recovery.

Huawei is reassured by the UK government’s confirmation to allow it to participate in the country’s 5G roll-out. Victor Zhang, Vice-President, Huawei, said in a statement that “This evidence-based decision will result in a more advanced, more secure and more cost-effective telecoms infrastructure that is fit for the future. It gives the UK access to world-leading technology and ensures a competitive market.” The British government said on Tuesday that it will allow Huawei to build the country’s next generation of super-fast wireless networks, despite the US’ threats that permitting Huawei equipment could undermine trade and intelligence ties with the US. Zhang said Huawei has a strong track record of supplying cutting-edge technology to telecoms operators in the UK for more than 15 years. It will continue with “supporting customers as they invest in their 5G networks, boosting economic growth and helping the UK continue to compete globally.” The clear cybersecurity record of Huawei has been recognized by two parliamentary committees in the UK, a country with the toughest oversight of our industry in the world, and the views of pre-eminent intelligence officials, all of whom agree there is no technical reason for excluding Huawei from the UK’s 5G network. The British Government has full access to evaluate Huawei’s products through the Huawei Cyber Security and Evaluation Centre, opened in the country in 2010. The oversight board of the facility is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer of the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre with members from the government including Government Communications Headquarters, as well as the UK telecommunications sector. Zhang added that Huawei agrees a diverse vendor market and fair competition are essential for network reliability and innovation, as well as ensuring consumers have access to the best possible technology. Dexter Thillien, a senior TMT analyst at Fitch Solutions, told CNBC that “Three is better than two,” he said, “If you ban Huawei, you have a choice between Ericsson and Nokia. You lack competition.” A study by Mobile UK shows that excluding Huawei would cost the UK economy £7 billion and result in more expensive 5G networks, raising prices for anyone with a mobile device. Across the EU, no government has imposed an outright ban on Huawei. Operators warn that banning Huawei may add years of delays and billions in costs to European countries’ 5G network launch. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said last week diversification is crucial to ensuring a country’s security in the roll-out of 5G mobile technology and shunning one supplier altogether risks being counterproductive. Zhang said Huawei’s focus will remain on supplying their customers with secure, reliable equipment so they maintain their support and continue to help create jobs and prosperity in the UK. Huawei stimulated a £1.7 billion contribution to UK GDP in 2018 alone, according to a research by Oxford Economics. Related

The UK government is expected to decide on whether to allow the technology giant Huawei to participate in the rollout of its 5G networks. British officials will reportedly greenlight the use of Huawei equipment in such networks. The US has ramped up pressure on the UK government to exclude Huawei from the country’s 5G network by threatening that allowing Huawei to operate its 5G network could put transatlantic intelligence-sharing or even the trade deal at risk. In spite of US pressure, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson insisted the UK can have technological progress while preserving national security. In his interview with BBC earlier this month, Johnson said: “The British public deserves to have access to the best possible technology. We want to put in gigabit broadband for everybody. Now if people oppose one brand or another then they have to tell us what’s the alternative.” UK’s telecoms companies have been using Huawei in its networks for the past 15 years, during which the world’s largest telecom equipment supplier kept a proven clear cybersecurity track record. The US administration has been trying to convince its allies not to allow the Chinese tech giant to form their 5G networks, claiming it would be a security risk, without providing any evidence. There is evidence shows excluding Huawei would cost the UK economy £7 billion and result in more expensive 5G networks, raising prices for anyone with a mobile device. British Government has full access to evaluate Huawei product ranges through Cyber Security and Evaluation Centre, opened in the country in 2010. The oversight board of the facility is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer of the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre with members from the government including Government Communications Headquarters, as well as the UK telecommunications sector. UK security agencies believe they have managed security concerns around the Chinese supplier so far and will be able to do so with the 5G network. The director-general of MI5, Andrew Parker, said earlier this month that he had “no reason to think” that using Huawei technology should threaten intelligence sharing with the US. The British government has reiterated that the “sustainable diversity in the 5G supplier market” is the centrepiece of the resilience of telecom networks, not just a question of in or out. Many believe that cutting competition by a reduction to just two vendor choices, cannot be good for the market and consumers, neither helpful to strengthening the resilience of telecoms networks that UK government describes as “of paramount importance”. Dexter Thillien, a senior TMT analyst at Fitch Solutions, told CNBC that“Three is better than two,” he said, “If you ban Huawei, you have a choice between Ericsson and Nokia. You lack competition.” In the interview with BBC, Johnson said: “There’s no reason why we shouldn’t have technological progress here in the UK, allow consumers, businesses in the UK to have access to fantastic technology, fantastic communications, but also protect our security interests and protect our key partnerships with other security powers around the world.” Despite the US’ restrictions and a prolonged campaign against its business, Huawei remains a leader in 5G competitive landscape. According to IPlytics GmbH, Huawei is the No.1 in terms of the number of 5G Standard Essential Patents (SEPs) and the number of 5G standards contributions. Huawei ranks 5 in terms of R&D investment on 2018 EU R&D Investment Scoreboard, followed by Nokia(27) and Ericsson(45). Huawei has played an important part in helping its UK carrier partners to develop and roll out both fixed and mobile networks throughout the UK. Huawei stimulated a £1.7 billion contribution to UK GDP in 2018 alone, according to a research by Oxford Economics. Furthermore, Huawei is found to have supported 26,200 jobs across the UK in 2018. This economic activity generated £470 million in tax revenues for the Exchequer. Across the EU, no government has yet imposed an outright ban on Huawei. Operators warn that banning Huawei may add years of delays and billions in costs to European countries’ 5G network launch. As Germany will take on the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union in the second half of this year, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said last week diversification is crucial to ensuring a country’s security in the roll-out of 5G mobile technology and shunning one supplier altogether risks being counterproductive.

______________________________________page_name: busiweek, post_id: 3475271119164564 https://www.busiweek.com/huawei-asks-court-to-overturn-fcc-order/
Huawei has mounted a legal challenge to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), seeking the court to overturn an unlawful order passed by the FCC on Nov. 22. The order bans carriers in rural America from tapping the Universal Service Fund (USF) to purchase Huawei equipment. In a petition filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Huawei asks the court to hold the FCC’s order unlawful on the grounds that it fails to offer Huawei required due process protections in labelling Huawei as a national security threat. Huawei believes that the FCC also fails to substantiate its arbitrary findings with evidence or sound reasoning or analysis, in violation of the U.S. Constitution, the Administrative Procedure Act, and other laws. “Banning a company like Huawei, just because we started in China – this does not solve cybersecurity challenges,” Huawei’s Chief Legal Officer Dr Song Liuping said at a press conference. Song said both FCC chairman Ajit Pai and other FCC commissioners failed to present any evidence to prove their claim that Huawei constitutes a security threat, and ignored the facts and objections raised by Huawei and rural carriers after the FCC first made the proposal in March 2018. “Huawei also submitted 21 rounds of detailed comments, explaining how the order will harm people and businesses in remote areas. The FCC ignored them all,” he said. “Carriers across rural America, in small towns in Montana, Kentucky, and farms in Wyoming – they choose to work with Huawei because they respect the quality and integrity of our equipment,” Song added. “The FCC should not shut down joint efforts to connect rural communities in the U.S.” Glen Nager, Huawei’s lead counsel for the legal action, said the FCC has simply adopted a standard-less rule that, by its own admission, was designed with only Huawei and another Chinese company in mind. In addition, Nager said the decision adopted by FCC exceeds the agency’s “statutory authority,” as the FCC is not authorized to make national security judgements or to restrict the use of USF funds based on such judgments. “Indeed, the Commission has no national security expertise or authority.” According to Nager, FCC’s designation of Huawei as a national security threat lacks legal or factual support. “The designation is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of Chinese law and on unsound, unreliable, and inadmissible accusations and innuendo, not evidence. The designation is simply shameful prejudgment of the worst kind,” he said. Karl Song, Vice President of Huawei’s Corporate Communications Department, said the FCC rule is threatening the improving connectivity in rural America, which depends on Huawei equipment because other vendors were not willing to do business in places “that were too remote, or where the terrain was difficult, or where there just wasn’t a large population.” He added that the ban and the following “rip-and-replace” proposal would cost hundreds of millions of dollars and even force some small carriers to go bankrupt.

Even with the 5G era already upon us, investment in 4G/LTE networks is still vitally important for operators in sub-Saharan Africa and must remain a core focus of network construction for the immediate future. This is according to David Chen, Vice-President, Huawei Southern Africa. “Currently, the mobile broadband penetration rate in Africa is only 47%, while 4G penetration rate is merely 10%,” Chen said. “Insufficient coverage causes LTE users to fall back to the 2G or 3G networks, resulting in a significant decline in user experience. It also leads to congestion on the 2G and 3G networks and makes it difficult to release the spectrum used by 2G and 3G.” Chen said that LTE and 5G complement each other and are evolving in parallel. In the next few years, 5G will mainly be used in more industrial communications. LTE will remain the primary choice for global mobile communications through 2025. It will form the basic layer of national networks, especially when it comes to mobile broadband access. “It will take a long time for 5G to provide nationwide continuous coverage. Before that, enhanced LTE networks can guarantee optimal user experience for 5G users, including services such as VR, AR, and cloud gaming,” said Chen. He said that it is important for operators to invest in 4G to secure future growth, as it is estimated that there will be an additional 80 million LTE users in sub-Saharan Africa by 2025. Driven by this growth, LTE traffic in sub-Saharan Africa will increase by a factor of 8.8. By 2025, about 80% of all data traffic in the region will be over an LTE network. LTE will also be the main source of future revenue for operators. “According to GSMA Intelligence, 2G and 3G users in sub-Saharan Africa will gradually migrate to 4G,” said Chen. “By 2025, the proportion of 2G users will drop from 46% to 12%.” Part of the reason for the migration to 4G is because the ecosystem is mature. “The price of feature phones supporting VoLTE in the sub-Saharan Africa market has been as low as $25,” Chen said. Since 5G equipment is already available, there is an opportunity for operators to build out their 4G networks while ensuring that they can evolve to 5G in future. Chen offered the following tips to operators to ensure they are ready for 5G: * All future equipment installations should be 5G ready, allowing easy upgrades to 5G through software updates. * Software should support multi-standard spectrum sharing to improve spectrum efficiency, and to allow the smooth migration of 2G and 3G users. * Networks must support 4G and 5G coordination, in terms of spectrum, operation and maintenance. This will ensure that users have a consistent experience as we enter the 5G era. * The value of existing ICT infrastructure, such as base station sites, must be maximised to avoid overlapping services and wasted resources. This would mean boosting the capacity and coverage of every station for optimum efficiency. * Carriers should explore the business case for all possible 5G innovations when building 4G networks, and not just embrace 5G for its own sake. This will mean building business models around IoT, video, live broadcast, augmented reality, and virtual reality. * It is important that operators build partnerships with providers that can support the ongoing spectrum evolution with fast site upgrades and large-capacity solutions. The idea is to maximise the value of 4G networks, and smoothly evolve to 5G without unnecessary infrastructure investment. Related

The worst foreign-policy decision by the United States of the last generation – and perhaps longer – was the “war of choice” that it launched in Iraq in 2003 for the stated purpose of eliminating weapons of mass destruction that did not, in fact, exist. Understanding the illogic behind that disastrous decision has never been more relevant because it is being used to justify a similarly misguided US policy today. The decision to invade Iraq followed the illogic of then-US Vice President Richard Cheney, who declared that even if the risk of WMDs falling into terrorist hands was tiny – say, 1% – we should act as if that scenario would certainly occur. Such reasoning is guaranteed to lead to wrong decisions more often than not. Yet the US and some of its allies are now using the Cheney Doctrine to attack Chinese technology. The US government argues that because we can’t know with certainty that Chinese technologies are safe, we should act as if they are certainly dangerous and bar them. Proper decision-making applies probability estimates to alternative actions. A generation ago, US policymakers should have considered not only the (alleged) 1% risk of WMDs falling into terrorist hands but also the 99% risk of a war based on flawed premises. By focusing only on the 1% risk, Cheney (and many others) distracted the public’s attention from the much greater likelihood that the Iraq War lacked justification and that it would gravely destabilize the Middle East and global politics. The problem with the Cheney Doctrine is not only that it dictates taking actions predicated on small risks without considering the potentially very high costs. Politicians are tempted to whip up fears for ulterior purposes. That is what US leaders are doing again: creating a panic over Chinese technology companies by raising and exaggerating tiny risks. The most pertinent case (but not the only one) is the US government attack on the wireless broadband company Huawei. The US is closing its markets to the company and trying hard to shut down its business around the world. As with Iraq, the US could end up creating a geopolitical disaster for no reason. I have followed Huawei’s technological advances and work in developing countries, as I believe that 5G and other digital technologies offer a huge boost to ending poverty and other SDGs. I have similarly interacted with other telecoms companies and encouraged the industry to step up actions for the SDGs. When I wrote a short foreword (without compensation) for a Huawei report on the topic, and was criticized by foes of China, I asked top industry and government officials for evidence of wayward activities by Huawei. I heard repeatedly that Huawei behaves no differently than trusted industry leaders. The US government nonetheless argues that Huawei’s 5G equipment could undermine global security. A “backdoor” in Huawei’s software or hardware, US officials claim, could enable the Chinese government to engage in surveillance around the world. After all, US officials note, China’s laws require Chinese companies to cooperate with the government for purposes of national security. Now, the facts are these. Huawei’s 5G equipment is low cost and high quality, currently ahead of many competitors, and already rolling out. Its high-performance results from years of substantial spending on research and development, scale economies, and learning by doing in the Chinese digital marketplace. Given the technology’s importance for their sustainable development, low-income economies around the world would be foolhardy to reject an early 5G rollout. Yet, despite providing no evidence of backdoors, the US is telling the world to stay away from Huawei. The US claims are generic. As a US Federal Communications Commissioner put it, “The country that owns 5G will own innovations and set the standards for the rest of the world and that country is currently not likely to be the United States.” Other countries, most notably the United Kingdom, have found no backdoors in Huawei’s hardware and software. Even if backdoors were discovered later, they could almost surely be closed at that point. The debate over Huawei rages in Germany, where the US government threatens to curtail intelligence cooperation unless the authorities exclude Huawei’s 5G technology. Perhaps as a result of the US pressure, Germany’s spy chief recently made a claim tantamount to the Cheney Doctrine: “Infrastructure is not a suitable area for a group that cannot be trusted fully.” He offered no evidence of specific misdeeds. Chancellor Angela Merkel, by contrast, is fighting behind the scenes to leave the market open for Huawei. Ironically, though predictably, the US complaints partly reflect America’s own surveillance activities at home and abroad. Chinese equipment might make secret surveillance by the US government more difficult. But unwarranted surveillance by any government should be ended. Independent United Nations monitoring to curtail such activities should become part of the global telecoms system. In short, we should choose diplomacy and institutional safeguards, not a technology war. The threat of US demands to blockade Huawei concerns more than the early rollout of the 5G network. The risks to the rules-based trading system are profound. Now that the US is no longer the world’s undisputed technology leader, US President Donald Trump and his advisers don’t want to compete according to a rules-based system. Their goal is to contain China’s technological rise. Their simultaneous attempt to neutralize the World Trade Organization by disabling its dispute settlement system shows the same disdain for global rules. If the Trump administration “succeeds” in dividing the world into separate technology camps, the risks of future conflicts will multiply. The US championed open trade after World War II not only to boost global efficiency and expand markets for American technology but also to reverse the collapse of international trade in the 1930s. That collapse stemmed in part from protectionist tariffs imposed by the US under the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act, which amplified the Great Depression, in turn contributing to the rise of Hitler and, ultimately, the outbreak of World War II. In international affairs, no less than in other domains, stoking fears and acting on them, rather than on the evidence, is the path to ruin. Let’s stick to rationality, evidence, and rules as the safest course of action. And let us create independent monitors to curtail the threat of any country using global networks for surveillance of or cyber warfare on others. That way, the world can get on with the urgent task of harnessing breakthrough digital technologies for the global good. Jeffrey D.

Huawei has boosted the 2019 edition of the MTN Kampala Marathon with 250,000,000 shillings towards maternal health care in Uganda. The 2019 edition of the MTN Kampala Marathon will be held on Sunday 24th November starting at the Kololo independence grounds with runners participating in either of 4 categories including; the full marathon (42Km), half marathon (21Km), 10Km race and 5Km wheelchair race/fun run. Huawei confirmed that it will participate fully in this year’s Marathon at Kololo and the regional runs of; Soroti, Arua and Masaka respectively. “This year we shall run for maternal health once again, and as we all know, one out of every 49 women die of a maternal complication related to pregnancy in Uganda and it’s the highest in the world. “We at Huawei believe that this issue can be solved once and for all and make Uganda a better place for pregnant mothers. “This then explains why we have come out to continue to sponsor this marathon with 250 million Uganda shillings. We are sure that with this contribution, Uganda can only be a better place,” says Liujiawei, the Managing Director of Huawei Uganda. “Just like last year, the MTN Marathon will have regional runs in Soroti, Arua and Masaka. I confirm that we look forward to participating as a company through branding, we shall give away some goodies to the participants and also have our representative in the regional runs,” he added. MTN Chief Marketing Officer, Sen Somdev hailed Huawei for its partnership and continued support for the MTN Marathon over the years. “MTN Uganda lauds Huawei for its enthusiasm to respond to the call to ensure that the Marathon continues to be a resounding success and a channel to support communities in need. “With Huawei’s involvement in the MTN Kampala Marathon, we have positively impacted communities from the proceeds raised from the MTN Kampala Marathon. “In the same way, our longstanding work relationship with Huawei has brought forth innovative digital solutions which have transformed the digital landscape for Uganda; and has certainly contributed to our vision of delivering a bold new digital world to our customers,” Somdev said. More than 250 Huawei staff have also confirmed participation in the MTN Kampala Marathon 2019. Related

Now that the celebrations marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China are over, it is time to direct attention back to the Sino-American trade war. That conflict may well be about to enter its endgame. Indeed, the next round of negotiations could be the last real chance to find a way through the trade, technology, and wider economic imbroglio that has been engulfing both countries. Failing that, the world should start preparing for its rockiest economic ride since the 2008 global financial crisis. There is a real risk that America will slide into recession, and that the global economy will experience a broader decoupling that will poison the well for Sino-American relations far into the future. There is also a widening window of opportunity for nationalist constituencies in both countries to argue that conflict is inevitable. Thus far, the trade war has gone through four phases. Phase one began last March when US President Donald Trump announced the first round of import tariffs on Chinese goods. Phase two arrived with the “Argentine reset” at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires last December, when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that they would conclude an agreement within 90 days. That truce imploded in early May of this year, with each side accusing the other of demanding major last-minute changes to the draft agreement. Phase three could best be described as the “summer of our discontent”: the United States imposed a fresh round of import tariffs, and China retaliated in kind, while also unveiling its answer to the US “entity list.” In response to the blacklisting of Huawei and five other Chinese tech companies, China’s poetically titled “unreliable entities list” threatens to target US firms for exclusion. Given these developments, why should anyone expect the next round of talks to succeed? For starters, the US and Chinese economies are both in trouble. In the US, recent poor manufacturing and private-sector employment figures have reinforced pessimism about the economy’s prospects. If conditions were to deteriorate further, Trump’s bid for re-election in November 2020 would be endangered. Likewise, Xi would be weakened by any significant slowdown on the eve of the Communist Party of China’s centenary celebrations in 2021, which will be a prelude to his bid for an already controversial third term starting in 2022. Each side says publicly that the trade war is hurting the other side more. But, of course, it is hurting both, by destabilizing markets, destroying business confidence, and undermining growth. Each side also claims to have the economic resilience needed to ride out an extended conflict. On this question, it is unclear who has the stronger argument. America is certainly less trade-dependent than China; but China, though weakened by poor domestic policy choices enacted before the trade war, still has stronger fiscal, monetary, and credit tools at its disposal. In any case, both sides recognize that they are each holding an economic gun to the other’s head. Hence, despite the political posturing, both Trump and Xi ultimately want a deal. Moreover, they need it to happen by the end of the year to prevent further damage from big tariff hikes currently scheduled to take effect on December 15. That timeline requires that both sides start taking symbolic and substantive steps immediately. As a first step, China should propose an agreement using the same text as the previous 150-page draft, but with revisions to satisfy its three “red lines.” Specifically, China should remove the US provisions for retaining tariffs after the agreement is signed, and for unilaterally re-imposing tariffs if the US concludes that China is not honouring the agreement. And it should add a commitment that China will execute the agreement in a way that is “consistent with its constitutional, legislative, and regulatory processes.” Second, China should improve its original offer of a $200 billion reduction in the bilateral trade deficit over time. This negotiating point is based on lousy economics, but it is important to Trump personally and politically. Third, while China will want to avoid banning state subsidies for Chinese industry and enterprises, it must retain the draft agreement’s existing provisions on the protection of intellectual property and the prohibition of forced technology transfers. Moreover, it may be possible to have each country declare its position on state industrial policy in the official communiqué accompanying the signing of the agreement. Such a statement could even specify the domestic and international arbitration mechanisms that will be used to enforce all relevant laws on competitive neutrality. Fourth, both sides must create a more positive political atmosphere. In recent weeks, there have been signs that this may happen, including reports of renewed Chinese purchases of American soybeans in September. Though purchases are still well below historical levels, this increase will help Trump to placate angry farmers in his base. The US, meanwhile, has already deferred a 5% tariff hike that was originally scheduled for October 1. It could also issue exemptions for some US firms to sell non-sensitive inputs to Huawei. Fifth, both sides should regard the November 14-16 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Santiago as the last chance for signing a deal. Following high-level negotiations between Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer this month, outstanding problems should be agreed in Beijing in early November. Getting the deal done before Thanksgiving will be critical to undergird US business and consumer confidence for the Christmas season. I am one of the few commentators who have argued all year that, despite the political fireworks, Trump and Xi’s underlying interests make a deal more likely than not. But the recently announced impeachment proceedings against Trump could throw a wrench into this process. A weakened Trump may be emboldened to take a tougher line against China than US economic interests demand. On balance, however, Trump still cannot afford the risk of a 2020 recession, meaning that a deal remains more probable than not. Nonetheless, a failure to manage the next two critical months could still cause the entire process to collapse. Both sides have already spent much time preparing a Plan B for 2020: to let lose the dogs of economic war, foment nationalist sentiment, and blame the other side for the ensuing damage. Should that happen, the risk of recession in the US, Europe, and Australia next year will be high, though China would seek to soften the domestic blow through further fiscal and monetary stimulus. The choice now facing the US and China is stark. For the rest of the world, the stakes could not be higher. This commentary is based on a recent address to the US Chamber of Commerce in Beijing.

______________________________________page_name: busiweek, post_id: 3117952734896406 https://www.busiweek.com/the-real-reason-for-chinas-rise/
SHANGHAI – China’s rapid economic rise in recent decades has astonished the world. Yet the reasons behind the country’s success are often misunderstood and misinterpreted. The rise of China widely attributed to its state capitalism, whereby the government, endowed with huge assets, can pursue a wide-ranging industrial policy and intervene to mitigate risks. Accordingly, China owes its success, first and foremost, to the government’s “control” over the entire economy. This explanation is fundamentally wrong. True, China has benefited from having a government with the capacity to implement comprehensive and complementary policies efficiently. With leaders not subject to the short election cycles that characterize Western democracies, China’s central leadership can engage in visionary and comprehensive long-term planning, exemplified by its Five-Year Plans. Moreover, the Chinese state’s power has buttressed its implementation capacity, which dwarfs that of most developing and transitional economies. A strong state – and the social and political stability that it underpins – has been essential to enable China’s rapid advancement in areas like education, health care, infrastructure, and research and development. It is telling, however, that China is using its long-term planning and robust implementation capacity not to entrench state capitalism, but rather to advance economic liberalization and structural reform. It is this long-term strategy – which has remained unswerving, despite some stumbles and short-term deviations – that lies at the heart of the country’s decades-long run of rapid economic growth. Interestingly, elements of this strategy come directly from the advanced countries. Over the last 40 years of diplomatic normalization with the United States, American-style capitalism has gained a solid foothold in China, not least among the country’s intellectual and business elites. So, while China’s government has always placed a high priority on stability, it has also worked to apply global best practices in many areas, including corporate governance, finance, and macroeconomic management. Yet this process of economic liberalization and structural reform is also uniquely Chinese, insofar as it has emphasized local-level competition and experimentation, which in turn have supported bottom-up institutional innovation. The result is a kind of de facto fiscal federalism – and a powerful driver of economic transformation. The fruits of this approach are irrefutable. In the last decade, a number of Chinese private financial and tech giants have emerged that, unlike their state-run counterparts, have managed to establish themselves as global leaders in innovation. The recently released Fortune Global 500 list for 2019 – which ranks firms by operating revenues – includes 129 Chinese companies, compared to 121 from the US. Among China’s Fortune 500 firms are e-commerce giants Alibaba, JD.com, and Tencent, the company behind the popular mobile app WeChat. The tech giant Huawei managed to rise 11 places since last year, despite US President Donald Trump’s campaign against the company. And the nine-year-old Xiaomi, a smartphone manufacturer, made history as the youngest firm ever to make the list. The spectacular rise of these companies – and the prosperity and competitiveness that they have helped to foster – was not enabled primarily by top-down industrial policies, but by economic liberalization and the bottom-up innovation it has facilitated. At a time when the US is accusing China of using state-capitalist tools – such as subsidies for domestic companies and entry barriers for foreign firms – to gain an unfair advantage, it is worth highlighting the extent to which the country does not owe its economic success to such policies. This is not to suggest that China’s own leaders should not also take note of its unfinished reform programs. After three decades of double-digit GDP growth rates, a slowdown was inevitable. But, even as China’s central government accepts some decline in annual growth, it must be alert and remain committed to addressing the structural factors that are compounding the trend, such as the rising cost of finance and declining return on capital. Meanwhile, China’s government must continue to encourage private entrepreneurship and innovation (and has already committed to doing so), while reinforcing its system of competitive quasi-federalism. And it must also accelerate governance reform, as promised, to ensure that it can keep up with further market liberalization. China has traveled far along the path of reform and opening up. But it should not underestimate the challenges ahead, let alone forget how it got this far in the first place. As a Chinese proverb puts it, “On a journey of a hundred miles, 90 is but halfway.” Zhang Jun is Dean of the School of Economics at Fudan University and Director of the China Center for Economic Studies, a Shanghai-based think-tank.

Huawei Technologies is known to be working on a new operating system, called Hongmeng, but the firm has insisted that it is not a replacement for Android. Huawei’s use of Android for its smartphone range has been in doubt ever since President Donald Trump signed an executive order in May that saw Huawei placed on an ‘entity list’ that prevents US companies from exporting products to it. Following that, Google announced it was cutting off Huawei’s access to some Android software and services. Hongmeng OS Google had said in May that users of existing Huawei devices, including those already sold or in stock globally, would continue to be able to access Google Play and Google Play Protect security services. But the blacklist meant that future Huawei devices could be barred from using Google’s commercial version of Android, as well as losing access to the Google Play store and popular Google Android apps such as Gmail, Chrome and Google Maps. Huawei hinted that it had an alternative OS under wraps that it was still developing. And in June Huawei applied for patents to trademark its “Hongmeng” operating system (OS) in at least nine countries and Europe. A Huawei executive was also quoted as telling German newspaper Die Welt that Huawei has a back-up OS in case it is cut off from US-made software. Huawei was known to be developing a Kirin OS a few years ago. Industrial OS But now the firm is saying the operating system it is building is being designed for industrial use rather than as a direct Android replacement, state media agency Xinhua reported. Huawei board member and senior VP Catherine Chen reportedly said that Hongmeng is not for smartphones and the company intends to continue to use Google’s Android operating system for its smartphones. Chen was quoted as saying that while an operating system for smartphones usually contains dozens of millions of lines of codes, Hongmeng contains much fewer – in the quantity of hundreds of thousands – and therefore very secure. The Hongmeng system also has extremely low latency compared with a smartphone operating system, she reportedly added. Last week American lawmakers reacted against attempts by President Donald Trump to ease the blacklisting of Huawei. Members of the US Senate and House of Representatives introduced bills to keep tight restrictions on Huawei. Related

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa backed Chinese technology giant Huawei last week at the 4IRSA digital economy summit in Johannesburg, where he outlined his government’s strategy to unlock economic opportunities in the digital era. Near the end of his speech, the President turned his attention to multilateral relations, which he said should also reflect an enabling posture for the global digital economy. Ramaphosa said the US action against Huawei was an example of protectionism which would affect South Africa’s telecommunications sector. “This standoff between China and the US where the technology company Huawei is being used as victim because of its successes is an example of protectionism that will affect our own telecommunications sector, particularly the efforts to roll out the 5G network, causing a setback on other networks as well,” he said. He said a number of telecommunication companies had written to him to express their concerns about trade restrictions that had been imposed on Huawei by the US government. “Telecom companies got together and wrote me a letter saying that this tussle between the US and China around the company called Huawei is going to hurt us because we can’t go to 5G and only Huawei can lead us to 5G,” he said. With the trade discussions between the US and China set to resume, Ramaphosa said the Chinese telecom giant was a victim. “We support a company that is going to take our country and indeed the world to better technologies, and that is 5G. We cannot afford to have our economy to be held back because of this fight. We are pleased that at the G20 Summit, China and US were able to meet and they said they will relax some of the constraints being imposed on Huawei, so that it can continue to deal with other various companies.” Related

Huawei has released a white paper on innovation and intellectual property (IP) and warned against the issue being politicized. Song Liuping, Huawei’s chief legal officer, said that IP is the cornerstone of innovation and its politicization threaten progress across the world. “If politicians use IP as a political tool, they will destroy confidence in the patent protection system. If some governments selectively strip companies of their IP, it will break the foundation of global innovation,” said Song during a Press Conference held at their headquarters. The paper, titled “Respecting and Protecting Intellectual Property: The Foundation of Innovation,” elaborates on Huawei’s practices in and contributions to innovation and the protection of IPR. It notes that innovation and intellectual property protection lie at the heart of Huawei’s success over more than 30 years. As of the end of 2018, Huawei has been granted 87,805 patents, of which 11,152 are U.S. patents. Since 2015, Huawei has received over 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in licensing revenue. Aside from accumulating patents of its own, Huawei has also paid more than 6 billion U.S. dollars in royalties to legally implement the IP of other companies, with nearly 80% of that paid to American companies, according to the document. Intellectual property is private property, protected by the law, and disputes should be resolved through legal proceedings, said Song, adding that in the past 30 years, no court has ever concluded that Huawei engaged in malicious IP theft, and Huawei has never been required by the court to pay damages for this. Huawei’s collaborative and respectful approach to IP is demonstrated by the simple fact that many of its technology breakthroughs are incorporated into the open standards that govern 3G, 4G and 5G. As a result, even though some countries do not buy products directly from Huawei, they still use the essential patents of Huawei and share in the benefits of the technology Huawei creates, said Song. Song also addressed Huawei’s stance on its use of patents, saying the company will not weaponize its portfolio of patents. Rather, he said, Huawei will adopt an open and cooperative attitude and follow the FRAND principle, or “fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory,” when engaging with relevant parties in the industry on patents licensing. “As always, Huawei is ready and willing to share our technology with the world. That includes 5G. It includes U.S. companies and U.S. consumers. Together, we can drive our industry forward and advance technology for all mankind,” said Song. The document also elaborates on how sustained innovation has helped Huawei’s success; how Huawei’s innovation brings huge social value; and Huawei’s stance on the use of third parties’ IPR and its own.

SHANGHAI – Just when a trade agreement between the United States and China appeared to be in sight, negotiators found themselves back at square one. The immediate reason for the disruption was China’s insistence on a substantially rewritten draft agreement, which, according to US President Donald Trump’s administration, reneges on previously agreed terms. But the root cause of China’s changes to the draft – the reason behind its reluctance to meet US demands – lies in a fundamental miscalculation by the Trump administration. Simply put, the US has been overplaying its hand. The agreement that China rewrote would have obliged the Chinese side to legislate some of the changes sought by the US, and it was negotiated amid an aggressive US campaign against the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. That campaign has included adding the company to America’s trade blacklist, thereby cutting off its supply of critical technologies, and pushing allies to isolate the company as well. While such actions will undoubtedly hurt Huawei, the company can eventually offset its losses by forging ties with other fast-growing Chinese tech companies. For the rest of the world, however, the Trump’s administration’s attacks on Huawei – and on China more generally – will have far-reaching consequences. China is too deeply embedded in global supply chains simply to go away. Alienating the world’s leading manufacturer and industrial producer – with its consumer market of 1.4 billion people – will severely disrupt global value chains and cast a shadow over the entire world economy. The Trump administration’s miscalculations may have resulted partly from acting in haste, in the hope of notching a “win” ahead of next year’s presidential election. But the US also seems convinced that it is up against a China with a particularly weak hand, owing to the risk of a hard landing for its economy. That is not the case. While China imports relatively little from the US, it may have more weapons than its opponent to deploy in this trade war. Beyond retaliating directly, through tariffs on agricultural products and commercial aircraft, it could tighten capital controls, dump its unparalleled holdings of US Treasury debt, or allow its currency to depreciate. (The wave of competitive devaluations triggered by the latter option would destabilize the US dollar, as well as the international monetary institutions.) So far, however, China has shown considerable restraint. For example, despite the renminbi’s recent depreciation against the US dollar, the People’s Bank of China has expressed its intention to maintain exchange-rate stability. Even if deepening tensions with the US over trade and technology force it to take some short-term retaliatory actions, China is likely to maintain this restraint for the foreseeable future. The reason is simple: this moderate approach serves China’s own long-term interests, both directly (by supporting continued economic growth and development, preserving social stability, and protecting state integrity) and indirectly (by avoiding further costly disruptions to global markets). Ironically, it also will compel China’s commitment to the very structural reforms that the US claims to be seeking. The trade war has highlighted the risks inherent in maintaining an open economy. But, rather than slam the door shut on the rest of the world, China is attempting to protect the global economy’s stability. China’s leaders do not believe that the trend of capitalist-led globalization – in which China has been both a leading beneficiary and, increasingly, a major contributor – will be reversed any time soon. Because the US remains, in China’s view, the world’s preeminent defender of the free markets toward which China is moving, its deviations from free-market orthodoxy and abuses of state power could shake America’s own economic foundations and threaten its institutions. To be sure, China and the US will most likely become increasingly estranged. China will develop its own core technologies, in order to end its dependence on the US, and build up the strategic sectors that will propel its economic development. But such technological progress on China’s part will, in any case, require the country to implement structural reforms. In particular, it will have to protect intellectual property rights and establish more efficient capital markets, in order to encourage basic scientific research, technological innovation, and entrepreneurship. Recognizing the role of capital markets in promoting technological innovation, China will open a Science and Technology Innovation Board at the Shanghai Stock Exchange later this month. This is not to say that China will close the door on trade negotiations. On the contrary, the US-China trade relationship does have its structural imbalances, which China is willing to address. But, rather than allow the Trump administration to push it to increase imports unilaterally – an approach that is both naive and reckless – China is insisting on resolving the problem in stages. The world should support this method, with the US, in particular, relaxing restrictions on exports to China and welcoming Chinese investment in the US. To many, China and the US appear to be falling into the “Thucydides Trap,” a self-fulfilling prophecy in which a hegemon, fearing a challenger, brings about a war for global dominance. But, even as the economic contest between the two countries continues, this outcome is far from inevitable. A lack of mutual political trust has not prevented the US and China from engaging in mutually beneficial commercial collaboration over the last 40 years, nor has it hampered the recent surge in cultural, educational, and other exchanges. At a time when the two countries face many common challenges – including climate change, nuclear threats, terrorism, poverty, and financial-market stability – one can only hope that the US administration once again shows the vision and wisdom needed to renew such cooperation with China.

Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei has expressed confidence in the company’s business and capacity, saying it had been preparing in anticipation of what is happening, and is well- prepared. “We will certainly be able to continue serving our customers. Our production capacity is huge, and adding Huawei to the Entity List won’t have a huge impact on us. We are making progress in bidding worldwide,” Ren said. The U.S. Commerce Department has announced it will add Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and its affiliates to its so-called “Entity List,” a move aiming to ban Huawei from buying parts and components from U.S. companies without government-approved licenses. The preparation he mentioned includes the company’s huge R&D investment and contingency plan. According to the 2018 EU R&D Investment Scoreboard, Huawei ranks fifth, with steady growth in its R&D investment. Huawei has a consistent Business Continuity Management System which has been certified by dozens of neutral third parties in Europe. The company has also been vigorously integrating BCMS into it global suppliers’ obligation. Ren conceded that he expected Huawei’s growth to slow down, but expressed confidence in the company’s future prospects. “In the first quarter of this year, our revenue grew 39% over the same period last year. This rate decreased to 25% in April, and may continue decreasing towards the end of this year. But the US ban will not lead to negative growth or harm the development of our industry.” The leaders of Britain, Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands said that their governments will not follow suit to ban Huawei from involvement in their networks. French President Emmanuel Macron said it was not the aim of France to block Huawei, nor to launch any form of technological war. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said companies could participate in expanding Germany’s 5G network if they met established safety criteria. In an interview with CNBC Africa on Wednesday, Huawei Vice President of Corporate Communications, Glenn Schloss said: “The devices in people’s hands are completely unaffected by what’s happening in the US. For owners of Huawei handsets it will be business as usual.” “We remain positive, but we are preparing for various eventualities. We are stockpiling components and have been working with our supply-chain partners for some time,” he added. Related

The shilling ended the week on a strong footing versus its American counterpart, buoyed by incessant foreign currency inflows. The local currency gained in Friday’s session with dollar appetite from corporates more than sufficiently met by inflows from various sectors of the economy. The USDUGX pair remains comfortable in the current ranges, and we expect the same band to continue holding this week, in the absence of new market moving information. Greenback nears two-year high The U.S. dollar neared a two-year high on Friday as the White House delayed auto tariffs, while trade tensions with China increased demand for safe-haven assets amid an equity selloff. Meanwhile, China’s state-run media took a surprisingly hostile stance on possible continued trade talks, saying it was meaningless” for officials to meet without the U.S. showing it is sincere. The tensions between the two largest economies in the world took a sour turn after the White House excluded Huawei and other Chinese companies from the U.S. market. Sterling slumped for the sixth day in a row, with GBP/USD down to $1.2744 as talks between the Labour and Conservative party stopped and the chances of a Brexit deal slimmed again. The euro briefly pared losses after the White House said President Donald Trump is delaying a decision for as long as six months on whether to impose tariffs on imported cars and parts to allow for more time for trade talks with the EU and Japan.

Uganda’s ICT and National Guidance minister Frank Tumwebaze has lauded Huawei for its consistency in skilling and nurturing ICT talent. He made the remarks during the commissioning of Huawei’s ICT Academy at Makerere University on May 14, 2019. The same ceremony saw 10 Seeds for the Future fellows flagged off for a two-week intense technological training from various Chinese universities. Seeds for the Future is a Huawei Corporate Social Responsibility program that seeks to establish collaboration with local governments, higher education institutes and other organisations to select top university students and young government officials to study and gain work experience at Huawei’s headquarters in China. Minister Tumwebaze noted that the efforts of this programme since its inception in Uganda in 2016 has started to gain fruit because of the seemingly relatively high rates of employment by its participants. “We have also been informed that out of the 30 participants of the Seeds for the Future programme since 2016 to now, approximately 21 are already employed by Huawei and other organizations while nine are still in school. This therefore is a good program with already notable fruits”, he said. In attendance was the representative of Chinese Embassy to Uganda Chen Huixin, who noted the ability of ICT in transforming economies through creations of jobs. “This is just one example of how ICT is transforming the lives of everyday citizens, and driving the economy. ICT has truly transformed our economy, creating jobs for people even in remote places. But this technological trend would never be possible if we did not skill students, professionals and entrepreneurs as a nation. That is why efforts such as the ICT Academy, Seeds for the Future and the Huawei ICT competitions are so important; so that Uganda whose economic fortune is also in digital transformation can continue to grow and leverage on ICT and the skills of its great people,” he said. Liujiawei, the Managing Director of Huawei said the students will leave for China on 17th May and return on 2nd June, and they will undergo training in the latest technological trends such as 5G among others. At the event, Huawei signed an MOU with Makerere to introduce its ICT Academy and also announced its initiative to train over 1,000 students free of charge in its established academies. Related

BEIJING – Huawei has today launched the world’s first core chip specifically designed for 5G base stations, Huawei TIANGANG. At a 5G launch event in Beijing that doubled up as a pre-briefing for the MWC Barcelona 2019, Huawei announced the innovative chip that will support simplified 5G networks and large-scale 5G network deployment all over the world. To date, the company has won 30 commercial 5G contracts and shipped over 25,000 5G base stations globally. Huawei is committed to taking complexity itself and creating simplicity for its customers. To this end, the company has invested heavily and continues to innovate. Its end-to-end 5G chips support networks of all standards and all bands (C band, 3.5G, and 2.6G), helping customers access the best wireless and microwave services. “Huawei has long been committed to investing in basic science and technology. We were the first to make breakthroughs in key technologies for large-scale 5G commercial use,” said Ryan Ding, Huawei Executive Director of the Board and Carrier BG CEO. “Huawei now has industry-leading capabilities to deliver end-to-end 5G, with simplified 5G networks and simplified operations & maintenance (O&M). We are leading the commercial rollout of 5G, and building a mature industry ecosystem.” World’s first 5G base station core chip At the event, Huawei launched the industry’s first 5G core chip, Huawei TIANGANG, with breakthroughs in integration, computing power, and spectral bandwidth. This chip is highly integrated, which means it can support large-scale integration of active power amplifiers (PAs) and passive antenna arrays into very small antennas. It also boasts super high computing capacity, with a 2.5-fold increase over previous chips. Using the latest algorithms and beamforming technology, a single chip can control up to 64 channels, which is the industry’s highest standard. This chip also supports the 200 MHz high spectral bandwidth, getting ready for future network deployment. This chip, according the company, also brings revolutionary improvements in active antenna units (AAUs), with 50% smaller, 23% lighter, and 21% less power consuming base stations. 5G base stations can be deployed in just half the time it took to install a 4G base station. These features will help address issues such as site acquisition and network deployment costs. Simplified 5G solutions for quick, large-scale 5G deployment Huawei began rolling out commercial 5G networks in 2018. It took the lead in the launch of a full range of commercial 5G products, 5G field testing and verification, and large-scale 5G commercial use. As of the end of 2018, Huawei has completed all pre-commercial testing and verification for its 5G products in China, green lighting 5G for commercial use. On January 9, 2019, Huawei’s 5G blade base station was awarded a First Class Progress in Science and Technology Prize, in recognition of its major technological breakthroughs and a unified modular design. All base station units use the blade form factor, and different modules can be combined as needed, making 5G base station installation as simple and easy as building blocks. “Huawei’s full-series, all-scenario simplified 5G products enable ultimate 5G performance and experiences,” said Yang Chaobin, President of Huawei 5G Network Product Line. “These products help significantly boost network deployment and O&M efficiency, and make 5G deployment easier than 4G.” AI for autonomous driving networks Huawei has also launched the world’s first data center switch with an AI brain. Boasting industry-leading performance, this switch enables zero Ethernet packet loss and end-to-end latency of less than 10 milliseconds. It consumes less than 8W of power while delivering more computing capacity than 25 mainstream two-way CPU servers combined. The company has also introduced its full-stack, all-scenario AI technologies to enable an autonomous driving network, and developed the SoftCOM AI solution to help operators maximize energy efficiency, network performance, O&M efficiency, and user experiences. During the event, Richard Yu, Huawei Executive Director of the Board and Consumer BG CEO, also announced the world’s fastest 5G multi-mode device chip and commercial devices. MWC 2019 runs from February 25 to 28 in Barcelona, Spain. Huawei is showcasing its products and solutions at booth 1H50 in Fira Gran Via Hall 1, booth 3I30 in Hall 3, the Innovation City zone in Hall 4, and booth 7C21 and 7C31 in Hall 7. Related

A global survey of Facebook posts, commissioned by Huawei on the occasion of launching their latest smart phone, brought about some astonishing results. Uganda, often referred to as the Pearl of Africa, made it to third position, and the location named was Mgahinga National Park, one of two gorilla habitats in the country. Colombo, Sri Lanka, topped the list, and Yokohama, Japan, came in as runner-up, but no one can argue that Uganda’s third place was well deserved, a destination for long underestimated and certainly undersold and under marketed in the past. Fourth was the German Spa city of Baden Baden, followed by Old San Juan on Puerto Rico in fifth place. Victoria Falls came in sixth – thought to be ranking higher – and was followed in the top ten by Kartapur in Pakistan, the Wadi Rum in the Kingdom of Jordan, the Icy Straight in Alaska, USA, and finally the Isle of Harris in Scotland. This is certainly a big boost for Uganda’s tourism industry which hopes that under a new regime at the helm of the Uganda Tourism Board the internal negativity can finally be overcome and progress be made to put the country not only on the global map but finally reach its full potential.

Chinese networking equipment maker Huawei Technologies has officially launched a new chipset aimed at servers. The move is being widely interpreted as a way for the Chinese giant to reduce its reliance on Western technology, as it finds itself in the midst of Western bans on the use of its 5G networking equipment over security concerns. The Huawei move comes after the US government almost put its fellow Chinese firm ZTE out of business last year, after a ban was imposed that prevented US companies from selling equipment (and chips) to the firm. The ban very nearly put ZTE, one of the world’s largest telecommunications equipment makers, out of business, since it was heavily dependent upon parts obtained from the US. But in July the ban was lifted after US president Donald Trump personally intervened, saying he wanted to protect Chinese jobs and also arguing that ZTE is a major buyer of US components. But that showed the Chinese that the US did have the means to hurt Chinese firms, that rely on the importing of US-based tech. And so now the Huawei server chipset arrival is helping China reduce its heavy reliance on imports. It should be remembered that Huawei gains the majority of its sales from telecommunications equipment and smartphones, but is seeking growth avenues in cloud computing and enterprise services in light of increasing Western suspicion. It already has its own mobile chipset (Kirin) and a chipset for AI (Ascend) and has now according to Reuters, launched the server chipset known as Kunpeng 920, which is designed by subsidiary HiSilicon. The thinking is that 7 nanometres, 64-core central processing unit (CPU) are aimed at the data centre sector, where the ARM-based architecture will help reduce power consumption. However, Huawei was keen to stress that it had no intention of becoming solely a chip firm. “It is part of our system solution and cloud servicing for clients … We will never make our chipset business a standalone business,” Ai Wei, who is in charge of strategic planning for Huawei’s chipsets and hardware technology was quoted by Reuters as saying. Intel partnership Meanwhile, another Huawei pointed out that it would continue its partnership with US chip giant Intel. Huawei aims to “drive the development of the ARM ecosystem”, said Chief Marketing Officer William Xu. He said the chip has “unique advantages in performance and power consumption”. Xu also said Huawei will continue its “long-term strategic partnership” with Intel. Huawei’s new ARM-based CPU is not a competitor to Intel’s x86 CPUs and servers, but complementary, Xu added. Computing is a growing business for Huawei, which only shipped 77,000 servers in 2012 when it first entered the hardware market. But in 2018 it shipped an impressive 900,000 units of servers. Huawei also released its TaiShan series of servers powered by the new chipset, built for big data, distributed storage and ARM native applications.

Huawei Global Rotating Chairman Ken Hu has said that they have secured 25 5G commercial contracts, ranking them number one in the world and have shipped more than 10,000 base stations already. “Almost all network customers have indicated they want Huawei, as the market leader with the best equipment for at least the next 12 to 18 months, for faster and more cost-effective upgrades to 5G. “Some security concerns based on the technology for 5G were very legitimate, but able to be clarified or mitigated through collaboration with operators and governments,” said Hu while addressing a press conference in China today morning. Hu said “Rare cases” have arisen where some countries are hijacking 5G issues for groundless speculation based on “ideological or geopolitical considerations”. He delivered strong messages of confidence in Huawei’s business growth and prospects, citing the trust of hundreds of network operators, nearly half of the Fortune 500 companies and hundreds of millions of consumers. “Other security concerns disingenuously raised as excuses to block market competition would slow adoption of new technology, increase costs for network deployment and raise prices for consumers. “If Huawei could compete in the US for 5G deployment from 2017 to 2020 some US$20 billion of capital expenditure in wireless infrastructure would be saved, according to some economists,” said Hu. Huawei revenue is expected to exceed US$100 billion in 2018. Hu addressed directly allegations against Huawei, stating that “it is best to let facts speak for themselves while emphasizing repeatedly the company’s security record was clean”. There had been no serious cybersecurity incident in 30 years. “Security is our highest priority and overarches everything,” said Hu. “Huawei has subjected itself to the strictest reviews and screening by regulators and customers while understanding concerns. However, no evidence indicated our equipment posed a security threat. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China had formally clarified that no law requires companies to install mandatory backdoors. The company is open to concerns about its openness, transparency and independence as well as dialogue. Any proof or evidence could be shared with telecom operators, if not to Huawei or the public,” said Hu. Hu described the company’s recent achievements as exciting and recalled his almost 30-year history with Huawei during which its people, culture and management had grown. “This is a journey of transformation that has helped us grow up from an unknown vendor to the 5G leader.” BY PAUL TENTENA Related

NEW YORK – The arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou is a dangerous move by US President Donald Trump’s administration in its intensifying conflict with China. If, as Mark Twain reputedly said, history often rhymes, our era increasingly recalls the period preceding 1914. As with Europe’s great powers back then, the United States, led by an administration intent on asserting America’s dominance over China, is pushing the world toward disaster. The context of the arrest matters enormously. The US requested that Canada arrest Meng in the Vancouver airport en route to Mexico from Hong Kong, and then extradite her to the US. Such a move is almost a US declaration of war on China’s business community. Nearly unprecedented, it puts American businesspeople traveling abroad at much greater risk of such actions by other countries. The US rarely arrests senior businesspeople, US or foreign, for alleged crimes committed by their companies. Corporate managers are usually arrested for their alleged personal crimes (such as embezzlement, bribery, or violence) rather than their company’s alleged malfeasance. Yes, corporate managers should be held to account for their company’s malfeasance, up to and including criminal charges; but to start this practice with a leading Chinese businessperson, rather than the dozens of culpable US CEOs and CFOs, is a stunning provocation to the Chinese government, business community, and public. Meng is charged with violating US sanctions on Iran. Yet consider her arrest in the context of the large number of companies, US and non-US, that have violated US sanctions against Iran and other countries. In 2011, for example, JP Morgan Chase paid $88.3 million in fines in 2011 for violating US sanctions against Cuba, Iran, and Sudan. Yet Jamie Dimon wasn’t grabbed off a plane and whisked into custody. And JP Morgan Chase was hardly alone in violating US sanctions. Since 2010, the following major financial institutions paid fines for violating US sanctions: Banco do Brasil, Bank of America, Bank of Guam, Bank of Moscow, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Clearstream Banking, Commerzbank, Compass, Crédit Agricole, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo, JP Morgan Chase, National Bank of Abu Dhabi, National Bank of Pakistan, PayPal, RBS (ABN Amro), Société Générale, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Trans-Pacific National Bank (now known as Beacon Business Bank), Standard Chartered, and Wells Fargo. None of the CEOs or CFOs of these sanction-busting banks was arrested and taken into custody for these violations. In all of these cases, the corporation – rather than an individual manager – was held accountable. Nor were they held accountable for the pervasive lawbreaking in the lead-up to or aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, for which the banks paid a staggering $243 billion in fines, according to a recent tally. In light of this record, Meng’s arrest is a shocking break with practice. Yes, hold CEOs and CFOs accountable, but start at home in order to avoid hypocrisy, self-interest disguised as high principle, and the risk of inciting a new global conflict. Undermining China Quite transparently, the US action against Meng is really part of the Trump administration’s broader attempt to undermine China’s economy by imposing tariffs, closing Western markets to Chinese high-technology exports, and blocking Chinese purchases of US and European technology companies. One can say, without exaggeration, that this is part of an economic war on China, and a reckless one at that. Huawei is one of China’s most important technology companies, and therefore a prime target in Trump administration’s effort to slow or stop China’s advance into several high-technology sectors. America’s motivations in this economic war are partly commercial – to protect and favor laggard US companies – and partly geopolitical. They certainly have nothing to do with upholding the international rule of law. The US is trying to targeting Huawei especially because of the company’s success in marketing cutting-edge 5G technologies globally. The US claims the company poses a specific security risk through hidden surveillance capabilities in its hardware and software. Yet the US government has provided no evidence for this claim. A recent diatribe against Huawei in the Financial Times is revealing in this regard. After conceding that “you cannot have concrete proof of interference in ICT, unless you are lucky enough to find the needle in the haystack,” the author simply asserts that “you don’t take the risk of putting your security in the hands of a potential adversary.” In other words, while we can’t really point to misbehavior by Huawei, we should blacklist the company nonetheless. When global trade rules obstruct Trump’s gangster tactics, then the rules have to go, according to him. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo admitted as much last week in Brussels. “Our administration,” he said, is “lawfully exiting or renegotiating outdated or harmful treaties, trade agreements, and other international arrangements that don’t serve our sovereign interests, or the interests of our allies.” Yet before it exits these agreements, the administration is trashing them through reckless and unilateral actions. The unprecedented arrest of Meng is even more provocative because it is based on US extra-territorial sanctions, that is, the claim by the US that it can order other countries to stop trading with third parties such as Cuba or Iran. The US would certainly not tolerate China or any other country telling American companies with whom they can or cannot trade. Sanctions regarding non-national parties (such as US sanctions on a Chinese business) should not be enforced by one country alone, but according to agreements reached within the United Nations Security Council. In that regard, UN Security Council Resolution 2231 calls on all countries to drop sanctions on Iran as part of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement. Yet the US – and only the US – now rejects the Security Council’s role in such matters. The Trump administration, not Huawei or China, is today’s greatest threat to the international rule of law, and therefore to global peace. Jeffrey D.

Video is driving the demand for data services as a key revenue generator for telecoms operators. At AfricaCom, the largest telecommunications event in Africa, global ICT giant Huawei highlighted the importance for carriers to focus on the end user experience and building a video ecosystem that will fully release new growth potential. Huawei held its 3rd Video Forum at AfricaCom to discuss the evolution of video services, latest Telco video ecosystems and design of video-oriented business and network strategies. “The strategic window for the video business opportunity is now open for Telcos. If video traffic proportion is doubled from 30% to 60%, DOU (Data of Usage) increases 5 times. The key is to enhance the user experience. As Huawei, we foresee a four hundred billion dollar market globally in video services for carriers over the next five years. Huawei hopes to strengthen the ability of operators to enhance the user experience and is committed to enabling operator success through video and experience-based network construction,’ said David Chen, VP of Huawei Southern Africa Region, during his opening remarks. During the Video Forum, Huawei said video business potential should be realised through an all-round strategic partnership between various video industry role-players especially, OTT video service providers. More than 100 delegates from African Telcos and the video industry, including TikTok, Viskit, Harmonic and Hisense participated in the forum to discuss the evolution of video service, Telco video ecosystem and video-oriented business and network strategies. Bobby Ramsoondur, Chief Marketing Officer of Mauritius Telecom said to ensure the best video experience, Mauritius Telecom deployed a nationwide pure fiber network and a 4K ready IPTV platform, in partnership with Huawei. “Mauritius Telecom, with a 100% fibre coverage to households and the right TV content positioning strategy, has set the momentum to ensure the best video experience for its customers. “Video network capabilities, being a crucial aspect of the video industry, Mauritius Telecom in partnership with Huawei has invested in a 4K ready IPTV platform. The company is aiming to provide its customers with a topnotch service quality and a Next Generation TV viewing experience,” Bobby says. Wanda Mkhize, Executive Content and VS Gaming at Telkom SA said, entertainment content is the biggest driver of internet usage and the genetics of a successful video product should at least include compelling content, a unique proposition in the market and an ability to reach scale. “Entertainment usage is determined by connection type and data accessibility. This is where the biggest need for upgrade lies. “Telkom has chosen to be an open enabler for both content provider and viewers. With services including FREEME and LIT, we provide always-on data connectivity, we aim for a 3-way-win business model between Operator, consumer and OTT,” Wanda said. Related

According to a report released by UN in May, today 55% of the world’s population lives in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to increase to 68% by 2050, with 90% of this increase taking place in Asia and Africa. An earlier report by the organization also projected that Africa and Asia together will account for 86 per cent of growth in the world’s urban population over the next 4 decades. As the human population gradually shifts from rural to urban areas, this unprecedented increase has already posed new challenges in terms of jobs, housing, and transportation. Cities are finding it increasingly complex to effectively manage the city and provide good services to citizens at the same time. With the development of information and communication technologies (ICT), the “Smart City” concept is emerging as a critical phenomenon in urban development. Using various ICT or innovative solutions, the Smart City integrates the city’s constituent systems and services to enhance the efficiency of resource allocation and utilization, optimize urban management and services, and improve the quality of life of citizens. Smart cities can be likened to a living organism with a “nervous system” (the network and sensors), connecting its “brain” (the control centre) with “limbs and organs” (departments and institutions), enhancing the city’s management and services. In this process, ICT solutions can play a critical role in connecting the digital and physical worlds across city administration, public services, and industries. Using new ICT including cloud computing, Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI), these solutions drive unified coordination, cross-sector collaboration, and intelligent analysis for effective management of city services. In some parts of Africa, due to the low fertility of African soils, before planting corns, beans or cassavas, people usually need to fertilize the soil. Similarly, if we want to see more applications that make cities smarter, we need to lay the foundation for them to “grow”. Huawei believes that connectivity brought by ICT infrastructure including mobile networks and fibre is the “soil”, which provides the fertile ground for important value-adding “crops”, which in this case are applications and services including Public Safety, E-government, E-education, E-health, E-agriculture and so on. We must keep enhancing the ICT infrastructure so that ICT services and applications can be more available, accessible and affordable to every ordinary citizen, and that these applications can enable the improvement of livelihoods, ease of doing business, and increase productivity. How can we make cities smarter to better meet the needs of their growing urban populations for housing, transportation, energy systems and other infrastructure, as well as for employment and basic services such as education and healthcare? First, the construction of smart cities is a giant system that interacts across systems and is a “system of systems”. It requires coordination across departments through the overall strategy and design, including setting goals, priorities, and implementation paths. This is essential rather than optional to ensure the system is designed in ways that are user-friendly, with appropriate technologies, and can be maintained, integrated with other systems and upgraded over time to be sustainable. Second, taking a two-step approach starting with Public Safety and then moving to other aspects of the Smart City. According to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, safety and security together with food and water are basic needs for all human beings. For a country and its cells, “Cities”, there is also a Maslow-like hierarchy of digital needs. Ensuring security is a basic requirement for a country or a city. It lays a solid foundation for a competitive nation and a dynamic city. Building Sustainable and Resilient Cities, the theme for World Cities Day 2018, is a call to action for all of us to rethink how cities may become better places to protect and enhance people’s lives, leaving no one behind. By making cities safer and smarter, ICT actually increases cities’ attractiveness. A report launched recently by UN-Habitat (‘The State of African Cities 2018: The geography of African Investment’) indicates that ICT and investment in African cities correlated to each other closely. The report highlights that improving ICT infrastructure is critical to attracting FDI, whilst the ICT industry itself is also a crucial sector for FDI since it offers the highest growth rates and the highest number of direct jobs along with manufacturing and that the two are closely linked. A lesson from the development of China, a country that fasts forward 40 years and has become the world’s second-largest economy from one of the poorest, is that problems can be solved in the process of development. With the help of technologies and innovations, we can solve common problems facing cities such as traffic congestion, high unemployment, crime, and environmental degradation by making cities safer and smarter. The 31st of October is celebrated as World Cities Day. It is an opportunity to raise awareness of the trends and consequences of increasing urbanization and the challenges and opportunities urbanization brings to sustainable development. It is also a chance to promote best practices, new ideas and partnerships between cities and different stakeholders. Related

Huawei has showcased the future of technology with latest technological trends like the Virtual Reality gaming technology, RuralStar solution and the Connected Cow Agricultural solution taking centre stage at the recently concluded MTN 20 year’s anniversary expo at Kololo Airstrip. “With our mission and vision of bringing digital to every person, home, organization for a fully connected intelligent world, we hope that Uganda will continue moving faster into LTE for inspiring the development of many new applications, integration of industries, while it is gaining experience of the 5G business model and strengthening the 5G Ecosystem. We highly believe that the technological revolution in a country like this will spur efficient administration, reduce administrative costs of governance, promote safety, increase economic productivity, create a digital Uganda, improve the standard of living and increase employment opportunities among others,” said Liujiawei the Managing Director of Huawei Uganda. According to Liujiawei, Huawei will keep focusing on helping its customers to improve user experience, enable innovative services for vertical industries and to build telecom networks with more vitality and longer life cycle. Huawei was at the 2017 Mobile World Congress (MWC) awarded for its outstanding contribution for LTE revolution to 5G and in 2018, it presented technologies and solutions for 5G, All-Cloud network, video, and IoT in order to achieve better connections, better business growth, and a better experience for its clients. At the same time, Huawei has kept the road to 5G a reality since investing and innovating it five years back. Approximately US$600 million has been invested in research and development into 5G technologies from connected vehicles and smart homes to AR/VR and hologram videos among others. The NB-IoT connected cow solution, WTTH (Wireless To The Home) and Rural Coverage solutions were also showcased at the MTN 20th Anniversary expo at Kololo. The connected cow solution uses the Narrow Band-IoT collar to monitor the cow’s activity by which to easily predict the Cow’s rut. The rut makes the cows to produce milk and trigger them to mating and breeding period. Farmers will easily check Cow’s rut notification anytime anywhere through a mobile app connected with the NB-IoT collar device. This increases farm productivity, efficiency and profitability. For African markets where fixed broadband penetration is still low and where most users are mobile-first, WTTx is a quick win for mobile operators, WTTx is one of the most feasible and fastest solutions not only to drive business growth for operators but also to minimize the digital divide and provide broadband services for more people. RuralStar2.0, an innovative site solution in terms of transmission, infrastructure, base station design, and energy. This solution addresses increasing demands for voice and data services from the unconnected and increases operator ROI for rural network deployment. This solution fulfils the following rural MBB requirements: 2G, 3G, or 4G rural MBB networks providing rates of over 10 Mbit/s at cell edges and cell coverage of 5 km; Extended 2G and 3G coverage at a maximum distance of 60 km from the nearest tower-mounted site, providing voice and data (over 1 Mbit/s at cell edges) services and cell coverage of 5 km.

Twenty-three years ago, when former South African President Nelson Mandela spoke in Geneva at the International Telecommunication Union’s World TELECOM 1995, he underlined the importance of universal access to communication and information. Mandela stressed the need to eliminate the divide between what he called the information-rich and the information-poor. His words were echoed by President Cyril Ramaphosa at the ITU’s Telecom World 2018, he mentioned the words inclusivity or inclusive at least 6 times in his 20-minute opening ceremony speech. Information and communication technology is developing at an unprecedented pace sweeping us into a digital era, where information has become a more important resource than raw materials and energy. The information economy is characterized by processing and developing data, instead of industrial production. Access to information is now essential for individuals’ development and national inclusive and sustainable growth. The African Union Agenda 2063 has acknowledged the importance of digital inclusivity to bring the continent on the par with the rest of the world as an information society. Many African countries have embarked on their individual digital transformation journeys, by providing government services digitally and expanding access to ICT to cover more areas. However, there are still many people on the continent especially from rural areas which still lack basic access to information. According to the GSMA, in 2017, the number of unique mobile subscribers reached the symbolic mark of 5 billion, with 3.5 billion of them using mobile networks to access the internet. Despite this achievement, there are still 3.8 billion people who remain offline, out of which 1.2 billion are not covered by a broadband-capable network – the vast majority of this uncovered population lives in the rural areas in developing countries. Africa is home to the largest number of developing countries. On average, 69 per cent of the African population does not have access to the internet, with many of those unconnected living in rural areas. A few months ago I travelled to Zambia where I visited Mushindushi, a small village 300 kilometres from Lusaka. There I heard that people usually climbed 2-story high ant hills to get a network to make a call. Due to poor coverage, locals don’t usually carry their mobile phones with them including teachers at a local primary school. Since we were planning to cover the area, I talked with one of the teachers and asked him what he was expecting the future to be with adequate network and access to the Internet, he hesitated for quite a while without eventually giving me an answer. This reminds me of a survey conducted by Facebook in 11 countries, which found that over two-thirds of people who currently offline do not know what Internet is, let alone how to benefit from this powerful tool.

The Minister responsible for Finance in exercise of powers conferred upon him under Section 118E and 119(1) of the Income Tax Act (as amended) issued an Income Tax Notice designating persons who are required to withhold tax on payments they make to suppliers. The new Notice which came into effect on 01 July 2018 revokes the old legal Notice of 2013 thereby providing a new list of persons required to withhold tax on payments exceeding one million shillings. The new Notice has 5,004 withholding tax agents compared to the previous list that had 392 withholding tax agents. The new Notice requires the persons who have been listed to withhold tax on payments for goods and services as well as on the payments for agricultural supplies that exceed one million shillings. The persons designated under the Notice are required to withhold tax at a rate 1% on payments for agricultural supplies and 6% on payments for goods and services. “The requirement to withhold tax on payments for agricultural supplies applies to any supplier notwithstanding that they are on the withholding tax exemption list. “Where it is reasonably expected that the amount for goods and services would exceed one million if made in one supply, then the withholding tax of 6% applies on that payment,” says Peter Kyambadde Director Tax and Corporate Services KPMG. He says the requirement to withhold tax of 6% on payments for goods and services does not apply to a persons included on the withholding tax exemption list as well as those whose income is exempted under the Income Tax Act. “Payment of professional fees to a resident person continues to attract withholding tax at a rate of 6% on the gross amount paid regardless of the amount paid unless the supplier is withholding tax exempted. “The tax that has been withheld should be paid to URA within 15 days following the month in which the payment was made. The corresponding withholding tax return should be filed by the same date. “ The 6% and/or 1% tax withheld is creditable to the payee where they have been provided a withholding tax credit certificate,” adds Kyambadde.

Huawei has presented a special award to Turkish professor Dr. Erdal Arikan, the inventor of polar codes for 5G, in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the development of communications technology. At the ceremony, held at Huawei’s global headquarters in Shenzhen, the company also honored more than 100 Huawei scientists and engineers who are working on standards and basic research. Basic research is key to industry development. Theoretical breakthroughs, often made after decades of focused scientific effort, help set the direction of technological progress. With 5G just on the horizon, the paper on polar codes that Professor Arikan published in 2008 defined an entirely new approach to maximizing the rate and reliability of data transmission. Polar codes are the world’s first channel coding scheme to bring us up against the threshold of Shannon’s limit, or the maximum rate that data can be sent with zero error at a particular bandwidth. Polar codes significantly improve coding performance for 5G. At the same time, they reduce the complexity of design and ensure service quality. In 2016, 3GPP (the international standards body responsible for 5G standards) adopted polar codes as the official coding scheme for the control channels of 5G New Radio (NR) eMBB interface. At the awards ceremony, Huawei founder Mr. Ren Zhengfei presented a medal to Professor Arikan. The medal, designed and manufactured by the Monnaie de Paris (Paris Mint), features an engraving of the Goddess of Victory with a red Baccarat crystal, symbolizing the importance of new communications technology in leading the world forward. After receiving the medal, Professor Arikan delivered an acceptance speech. “I am honored to be here today receiving this award,” he said. “It gives me pleasure to acknowledge that, without the vision and technical contributions of Huawei directors and engineers, polar codes would not have made it from lab to a standard in less than 10 years. And as engineers, there is no greater reward than seeing our ideas turn into reality.” Huawei Rotating Chairman Eric Xu also spoke at the event: “5G standards are the result of a worldwide effort to drive progress in basic research and wireless communications technology. For these standards to take shape, it took more than 10 years of hard work from tens of thousands of scientists and engineers, along with dozens of companies around the world. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Professor Arikan, as well as his peers in academia, fellow scientists, and Huawei employees who have all contributed to 5G.” In 2010, Huawei recognized the potential in polar codes to optimize channel coding technology, so the company invested in further research to build on Professor Arikan’s work. Through years of focused effort, the company has made multiple breakthroughs in core polar code technology, helping polar codes move beyond the realm of academic research and see the light of day. “The birth of 5G standards is only the beginning of a new journey,” Xu added. “We will continue to work hard to ensure that 5G technology – including polar codes – creates greater value for society, and sooner. At the same time, we hope that the close collaboration between companies and the academia, like the one between Huawei and Professor Arikan, will continue, and give rise to more scientific marvels that drive the development of the ICT industry and society as a whole.” At the awards ceremony, Huawei also honored more than 100 of its in-house scientists for their work on basic research and standards. In particular, the company wanted to recognize their successful research in 5G New Radio and their eight groundbreaking innovations, including new waveforms and new coding schemes. These scientists worked closely with industry partners to verify key technologies and drive the standardization process, making an important contribution to 3GPP’s 5G Release 15 standards. Thanks to their pioneering work, Huawei was the first company in the world to complete 5G testing for all phases of IMT-2020 development (a collectively held vision, set by the International Telecommunication Union, for mobile network evolution by the year 2020), with results that far outperformed the key indicators for all three 5G usage scenarios defined by the International Telecommunication Union – enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC), and massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC). As a major contributor to 5G standards, and a core patent holder, Huawei is committed to following the FRAND principle for all patent licensing. That means Fair, Reasonable, and Non-discriminatory patent licensing – a principle that the company has adhered to in the past, and will continue to adhere to moving forward. Huawei aims to build a robust 5G ecosystem together with other players. Strong R&D investment has been a core focus at Huawei for years, investing nearly CNY400 billion in R&D over the past decade. Moving forward, Huawei will increase investment in basic research by earmarking 20% to 30% of its annual US$15-20 billion R&D budget to basic research alone.

Recently my company Huawei was strongly criticised by several members of the US Congress. They asked the US secretary of education to investigate whether our co-operation with US universities on basic scientific research might threaten US national security. I believe this criticism displays an ignorance of how contemporary science and innovation work and I recently described it as “ ill-informed” in a media interview. I did not mean this as a personal attack. Rather I was seeking to highlight the importance of academic freedom as an essential feature of modern universities, one that underpins all technological development and helps cultivate the next generation of scientific talent. Academic freedom is the cornerstone of higher learning. This freedom from political and other interference allows the US consistently to attract the world’s brightest minds to study and conduct research within its borders. It also supports the US’s continued status as a global technology leader. I hold a doctorate in engineering and have experience in basic research, which the National Science Foundation defines as “study directed toward greater knowledge or understanding . . . without specific applications toward processes or products”. While corporate research and development tends to focus on commercial outcomes, universities devote time to mathematics, algorithms, material science and other applications that might never make money. Even if the research pays off eventually, closing the gap between a theory and a commercial product can take decades. Collaboration between universities and businesses can accelerate this process. The exchange of knowledge and resources among the private sector, academia, and research institutes, known as knowledge transfer, has become a vital driver of scientific and technological progress. But US federal funding for higher education research has fallen steadily over the past decade. Today it represents less than 50 per cent of total American university research funding. Corporate sponsorship from companies such as Huawei provides much of the rest. The amount of money we allocate for research at US universities is relatively modest — approximately $10m last year. But it provides needed support in the form of funding, facilities, and laboratory equipment. Our collaboration with universities gives college and postgraduate students the chance to receive training and hands-on experience. We provide this support with no expectation of direct commercial return. Contrary to what our critics allege, the fruits of this research constitute a public good rather than a threat to America. The findings made possible through our university partnerships are published and disseminated worldwide through dissertations and papers by professors, PhDs, and postgraduate students. Like other corporate supporters of university research — including US businesses that support Chinese universities — Huawei does not gain exclusive ownership of, or access to, the findings of the research we support and we do not dictate what is published. Science is borderless, and we hope that the results of our partnerships will reach as many people as possible. Like any technology company, Huawei benefits from the general advancement of science and technology worldwide. Ultimately, however, our ability to provide competitive products is a result of our own long-term investment in R&D. Last year, Huawei invested $13.8 billion in research and development globally, bringing our total investment over the past decade to more than $60 billion. Huawei has been granted nearly 80,000 patents worldwide, including 10,000 patents in the US. Many of these are essential patents vital to the telecommunications industry. As such, they represent our modest contribution to the development of the digital economy. Before any basic research can deliver tangible benefits to society, universities and businesses must set off together on a long and sometimes arduous journey.
